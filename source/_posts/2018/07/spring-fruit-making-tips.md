<div>    <div>        1. How to collect fruit     </div>    <div>        PENACCODUS OPERATIONAL EVENT The island is caught in a 45-trench         tropical island or 55-plus snowy island.     </div>    <div>        =&gt; I heard that it is good if it is a great success.     </div>    <div>        It does not matter whether it is a jackpot or not because you have to         mix fruit juices infinitely.     </div>    <div>        Failure should not be allowed. (This is because fatigue is reduced or         the body gives offensive effects.)     </div>    <div>        <div>            2. Making fruit juice         </div>        <div>            You need two fruits and one sugar (or one honey) to make fruit             juice.         </div>        <div>            When picking fruits, there are three kinds of ops.         </div>        <div>            High acidity / high sugar content / soft flesh is attached. (Except             for the bad off)         </div>        <div>            When I first made fruit, I made fruit juice in just one time and             made fruit juice.         </div>        <div>            At that time, there was a good obligation on the fruit market.         </div>        <div>            (For example, increase in awareness, increase in skill, increase in             collecting ability, increase in mining ability, etc.).         </div>        <div>            Of course, if you increase your collecting ability and increase             your mining ability by more than 26 reps,         </div>        <div>            When you make fruit juice with a mixture of fruit juice, it is hard             to get fruit juice with more than 26 rep.         </div>    </div>    <div>        <div>            =&gt; Tips for making fruit juice         </div>        <div>            1) When making fruit juice for the first time, just mix it.         </div>        <div>            (Because the fruit of the original is from 1 to 2 levels most of             the time, the 3rd level is rare and the 4th to 5th level is almost             non-existent).         </div>        <div>            2) When mixing once more with the finished fruit juice, mix it             while looking at the ops, and you have a high level option.         </div>        <div>            =&gt; How to raise the fruit liquid option level         </div>        <div>            <div>                The result from mixing the fruit juice for the second time is                 random, but when mixing fruit juices at the same level of the                 same ops             </div>            <div>                A high probability that a high level of high-level adheres to                 the fruit juice.             </div>        </div>        <div>            ex) High acidity LV.2 + High acidity LV.2 = High acidity LV.3         </div>        <div>            High sugar content LV.2 + High sugar content LV.2 = High sugar             content LV.3         </div>        <div>            Soft flesh LV.2 + Soft flesh LV.2 = Soft flesh LV.3         </div>        <div>            The only thing to be careful about here is that you have to mix the             fruit juice of the same ops.         </div>        <div>            Otherwise, it is difficult to raise the level of the ops.         </div>    </div>    <div>        <div>            3. Special op (woody, fruity)         </div>        <div>            Now I'm going to talk about a special op you are most interested in             making spring fruit.         </div>        <div>            As it has been before,         </div>        <div>            Increase slaughtering ability or increase building capacity,             increase furniture production ability, or increase craft and             weapons production ability         </div>        <div>            Fruit flavor =&gt; Increase armor production ability, increase             sewing ability or increase cooking ability, increase farming             ability         </div>        <div>            Each of these options is randomly attached.         </div>        <div>            (If you have a special opponent because it is random, you may not             have any of the above options.)         </div>        <div>            1) How to express the incense of wood         </div>    </div></div><div>    <div>        In order for the incense of wood to appear, it is necessary to mix the         high acidity and make the fruit juice.     </div>    <div>        In the case of me, the acidity is high. LV.4 + the acidity is high.         LV.4 = LV.1 ~ 2 of woody fragrance.     </div>    <div>        =&gt; The combination of high acidity is required to randomly blend         with the wood.     </div>    <div>        The higher the pH level, the higher the opacity level.     </div>    <div>        Let's increase the fruit liquid level first and then combine the         results.     </div>    <div>        2) How to manifest fruit-flavored ops     </div>    <div>        In order for the fruit-flavored ovate to be expressed, it is necessary         to mix the fruity ovens to make fruit juice.     </div>    <div>        For me, soft flesh LV.4 + soft flesh LV.4 = fruit flavor LV.1 ~ 2 came         out.     </div>    <div>        =&gt; The combination of soft pulp must be combined randomly to get a         fruit flavor.     </div>    <div>        Here, the level of the soft flesh must be high.     </div>    <div>        Let's increase the fruit liquid level first and then combine the         results.     </div>    <div>        <div>            The photo below is the fruit of the fruit I made for a few days.         </div>        <div>            The level of opaque is low because it is made of one or two levels             of woody or fruity ops         </div>        <div>            It is expected that the higher the level of these options, the             higher the output level of the output.         </div>    </div></div><div>    I am trying to put these finished products on the line, </div><div>    Rose is putting a few on the island of Boltimore. He </div><div>    I have raised the price at a low price, but it is getting quite cheerful. </div><div>    <div>        As you know, lots of spring fruits are randomly available.     </div>    <div>        I just want you to understand that it was so hard to say that it was         hard to tell, so I wrote this by my experience.     </div>    <div>        I've been making it, and I've come to write things that I feel a little         bit worried about.     </div>    <div>        I did not write with bad intentions, but I wrote a long piece to share         good information with many people.     </div>    <div>        therefore     </div>    <div>        If you do not want this or have another tip     </div>    <div>        I would like you to take a warm look and give me a comment.     </div>    <div>        The fix will continue to be done. ^^     </div>    <div>        Thank you for reading the long story.     </div></div>
