No, don’t take it that contrarily.

In any case, slight increment. That is insignificant on the off chance that you inquire me. In any case, the contort most likely is, in future, as indicated by what I have perused up until now, Google will build the impact of this “lift” and that time, you’ll be desirous of WordPress locales.<br>So, you’ve got the reason to follow this guide but, let’s<br>first read some important points:<br><br><br><ol><li><br>                Your traffic will be down for few days until Google correctly<br>                indexes all your URLs with HTTPS.<br>            </li><li><br>                During this all process, if you made any mistake, then your<br>                blog can go down for few hours (so, consider doing this all<br>                after 12 AM if you get most of your traffic from India)<br>            </li><li><br>                You’ll have to remove all the widgets that are<br>                hosted/attached to non-SSL hosts.<br>            </li></ol>If it’s not too much trouble Note: In case you’re not that techy or are new to blogging or terms like “Facilitating,” “CDN,” then I’ll not suggest you going further. Rather, take a gander at this segment. Additionally, I’m not going to expound every one of the things. I’ll clarify as it were primary principle things to keep this short guide, short.<br><h3>            Moving From HTTP To HTTPS<br>        </h3>So, let’s start the process. Firstly, we’ll change the<br>default nameservers. In my case, my domain registrar was GoDaddy and<br>so, in this post, I’ve shown the settings of GoDaddy only. If<br>your domain registrar is not same, then see this section of the post.<br><ul><li>Firstly, sign into your domain registrar (in our case,&nbsp;it’s GoDaddy)<br>            </li><li>Open DNS Manager, now open a new tab<br>            </li><li>Open&nbsp;<a href="https://www.webmanajemen.com/page/safelink.html?url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2xvdWRmbGFyZS5jb20vYS9zaWduLXVw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferer noreferrer external" alt="Activate HTTPS on Blogger third party Domain 100 Worked" title="Activate HTTPS on Blogger third party Domain 100 Worked">CloudFlare sign up page</a>&nbsp;and sign up there and then, you’ll get this page:</li><img alt="screenshot_77" border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S6dClvQCM-0/WBmof_ALjEI/AAAAAAAAAz4/kckCMM2TIWQb3KUSw8LVs07Og0cp12M3wCLcB/s1600/screenshot_77_min_min.png" title="screenshot_77" itemprop="image">            <br><li>Now, type your domain in the box given and click “Scan<br>                DNS Records.”<br>            </li><li>After about 60 seconds, CloudFlare will complete scanning your<br>                domain’s DNS records, and now you’re ready to do<br>                some manual action.</li><li>                Go to your Domain Registrar’s DNS manager and then, you<br>                have to copy all the DNS records from Registrar’s DNS<br>                manager to CloudFlare DNS manager.</li><li>                It’s easy. You just have to copy all of them, except the<br>                ones that are already on CloudFlare. Just do it one-by-one and<br>                this will get done within some jiffies.</li><li>                Now, for this tutorial, we’re going to use their<br>                “FREE” Plan which is limited to limited SSL<br>                (elaboration- your site will not open up in older Androids and<br>                mobiles).</li><li>                In the next page, you’ll be asked to choose plans. Choose<br>                FREE just for now (we highly recommend Pro Plan)</li><li>                Now, you’ll be given two nameservers, and it’s the<br>                time to place those nameservers on your domain registrars to<br>                enable CloudFlare to get control over the blog.</li><li>                Now, go back to your registrar and find settings to change<br>                nameservers. In GoDaddy, it is- Settings &gt; Nameservers &gt;&nbsp;Manage<br>            </li><br>            <img alt="screenshot_81" border="0" height="295" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zQjHiOVCwR8/WBmofwUOHRI/AAAAAAAAAz8/TleaE-GLuv4D12wUKHszIDmO92vZZJizgCLcB/s640/screenshot_81.png" title="screenshot_81" width="640" itemprop="image">            <br>            <img alt="screenshot_82" border="0" height="475" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Mr0WweJu_Dc/WBmca6yeHwI/AAAAAAAAAxo/hkZFRbBIBq40n9KXaPnDfv3QAQvHoQTwQCLcB/s640/screenshot_82-min.png" title="screenshot_82" width="640" itemprop="image">            <br><li>Change Nameservers to ones that CloudFlair has given you and<br>                save.

You’ll see that your blog is being<br>redirected to HTTP all the time whether is it a subdomain or the main<br>domain and keeping the directory (characters after the domain). Now,<br>what’s next? You should not forget that the links in your blog do<br>not have “HTTPS” in their starting and to let Google know<br>that you’ve moved to HTTPS and get your new URL indexed faster,<br>you should change all your blog links from HTTP to HTTPS.
