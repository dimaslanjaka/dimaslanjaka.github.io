Well, anyway SEO problems, this time the             blog admin mas-sugeng.com most handsome want to try to review a             little bit about SEO, namely the impact of SEO for your site, even             my own less familiar with SEO: p.         <br><br></div><div>What is the impact of SEO for your site, how it looks like a lot of             people who love to talk about SEO. Is that SEO can make our site is             cool or what?

Make Your Site Design Ugly         <br><br>Lah anyway, what weve do the same SEO website design? Yes obviously             there is dong, SEO it will make less buddy or even ignore, the             design of the site, because my friend thinking more about how to             become # 1 in the search engines. As a result, the design of your             site to be ugly and messy.         <br><br></div><div>2. Your Site Being Lonely Visitor         <br>Silly, right SEO purposes so that visitors so much, why so quiet             anyway? Yes, weve really SEO is the goal to increase the visitors,             but if my friend is not serious and is not consistent in doing SEO,             then your site will be empty.Moreover, if my friend think too much             about SEO excessively without paying attention to quality content             present buddy, do not expect the site mate will have a visit in             abundance.         <br><br></div><div>3. Your site will be branded as the site Abal-Abal         <br>Ancur site design, content is not qualified, then eventually the             site mate would be labeled as fake websites that do not provide any             benefit for visitors. This is all due to my friend too busy with             SEO without thinking about how to make the site look and how to             present a piece of content that can provide benefits to visitors.         <br><br></div><div>4.
