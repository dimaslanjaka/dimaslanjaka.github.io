Your Google AdSense account banned? You do not feel committing an offense? If so, immediately submit an appeal. If you do not know how, this article will provide you with information on how to appeal your Google adsense account that was banned or disabled by reason of invalid activity for other reasons.<br><div>Running Google adsense advertising program or a Google ads publisher can be spelled out easy, even if I think personally more difficult than easy.Because in addition to always be obedient to the policy of Google, we must also intensively keep our adsense account from various things that could endanger the account, because if we are negligent or unaware, consequently our Google adsense account will be disabled because it is considered to have violated the rules that have been agreed. </div><div>As it happened to my account some time ago, suddenly ads are not running and login access to my Google adsense dashboard is disabled. It's very sad, but I do not feel at all violating, fortunately Google still gives an opportunity to anyone whose account is disabled to recover the account by appealing. And on this occasion I will share how to appeal Google Adsense account which is disabled because of invalid activity to be approved. </div><div>Before we go on how to appeal Google Adsense account that is disabled because of invalid activity to be approved. It would be nice to explain the chronology that happened to my account, so it would be a valuable lesson for my friends who are both running Google advertising programs or as publishers of Google adsense ads. <br><br><div><a href="http://weblight.in/?lite_url=https://res.cloudinary.com/dimaslanjaka/image/fetch/https://goo.gl/zYJ88W" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow"> <img alt="Cara mengajukan banding akun google adsense" id="-wl-ii1" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dimaslanjaka/image/fetch/https://goo.gl/zYJ88W"> </a> </div></div>On the 26th of May 2017 at 6:30 pm, I noticed that there was something strange about traffic on my blog, initially online being seen there were 29 visitors, a few moments later the visitor increased to 129 people, and continued to grow to penetrate 1229 people, really very out of the ordinary, I immediately open Google analytics and see there are 1200 online visitors coming from the United States.<br><br>Because I am very sure that traffic is not a real traffic but a robot or something that essentially there is trying to damage the refutation of the Blog and my Google Adsense account, so as soon as I delete all the ad code and I also delete the authority of the site, and 10 minutes later I change the ad code adsense on my blog using ad code from different adsense account.<br><br>After the ads go live as usual, I re-intend to open the adsense account that was, but what surprised me, because when logged in directly get a notification if the login access my adsense account has been disabled by the reason of invalid activity, I immediately open an email, and get an email with a sound like in the picture below.<br><br><div><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dimaslanjaka/image/fetch/https://goo.gl/jeAEFs" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow"> <img alt="Email yang menyatakan kalau akun google adsense di nonaktifkan" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dimaslanjaka/image/fetch/https://goo.gl/jeAEFs"> </a></div><br>In the picture above it is clear that my adsense account is banned, but there it says if Google still gives me the opportunity of cooperation I am willing to comply with all policies, by appeal, but before appealing, I am required to read the reason for closing the account, (See my URL give red circle).<br><br>When I click the url it turns out the closure of my adsense account is caused by invalid traffic, in accordance with the events I mentioned above earlier. So the deactivation of my Google Adsense account is not due to the click boom or click on my own ads, but because of the invalid traffic.<br><br><div><a href="https://goo.gl/qaZscf" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow"> <img alt="Bentuk pelanggaran yang mengakibatkan akun google adsense dibanned" src="https://goo.gl/qaZscf"> </a></div><br>Well if there are among readers whose Google adsense account is disabled, you should before appealing first read what is the main reason for closing adsense account, because if wrong in giving information, very difficult your appeal to be granted, and according to some friends who have experienced banned adsense account, if the first appeal is rejected, then how many times appeal will still be rejected.
