<p class="post-title entry-title" id="h3_6f6f_0" itemprop="name"><span style="font-weight: normal;">This one is a famous request in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/blogger?hl=en" id="a_6f6f_0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow">Blogger Help Forum</a>&nbsp;- instructions to shroud the sidebar on one of the static pages, and make the principle blog appear in full width in that page, and in that page alone. As a rule, I'd give a customize answer for every asker, as every one of them had diverse blog with various format that had distinctive settings.

Or, on the other hand possibly I will. You get the opportunity to conceal your sidebars (doesn't make a difference left, right or both) and utilize that space to extend your fundamental posting territory, on pages that you pick. You can apply this change both on your static pages or potentially your post pages (the page that heaps when you tap on the title of your posts).</span></p><br><div class="separator" id="div_6f6f_1"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q-AHZo_sm-c/Tbx33FuXgVI/AAAAAAAAC2I/h9SaOe4k_AE/s1600/0.jpg" id="a_6f6f_1" imageanchor="1" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow"><span id="span_6f6f_0"><img border="0" id="img_6f6f_0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q-AHZo_sm-c/Tbx33FuXgVI/AAAAAAAAC2I/h9SaOe4k_AE/s500/0.jpg"></span></a></div><br><a href="http://www.test6.southernspeakers.net/p/no-sidebar.html" id="a_6f6f_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow"><span id="span_6f6f_1">Live DEMO</span></a><br><br>Did I mention that this is a one-step tutorial?<br><a href="https://draft.blogger.com/null" name="more" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow"></a><br><div id="div_6f6f_2"><b>Step 1:&nbsp;</b><br><br><b>Backup Template (export on themes section)</b><i>&nbsp;- Close -&nbsp; Edit HTML - Proceed -&nbsp;</i>Find for&nbsp;<i><b>&lt;/b:skin&gt;</b></i>&nbsp;- Paste the following codes below&nbsp;<i><b>&lt;/b:skin&gt;</b></i>&nbsp;- Change the URL in&nbsp;<i>Line 1</i>&nbsp;to the URL of your page.<br><a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/dimaslanjaka/7c84830dd04bc5dded564316bf3a8499/raw/f1efe59bc0cbf2ad3e5946fa25c20c2752c8389b/code1.html" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow">HERE THE CODE</a><br>The code set up:<br><br><div class="separator" id="div_6f6f_3"></div><div class="separator" id="div_6f6f_4"></div><div class="separator" id="div_6f6f_5"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vJOGem9y2bY/Tbx34ljlZ_I/AAAAAAAAC2M/TPqITQahN98/s1600/1.jpg" id="a_6f6f_3" imageanchor="1" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow"><span id="span_6f6f_2"><img border="0" id="img_6f6f_1" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vJOGem9y2bY/Tbx34ljlZ_I/AAAAAAAAC2M/TPqITQahN98/s500/1.jpg"></span></a></div>Once more, remember to change the deliver in Line 1 to the address of your page.
