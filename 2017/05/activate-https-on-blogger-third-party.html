Too, oh my goodness that I have a few bits of new substance to compose in the up and coming days. In this way, on the off chance that you haven’t yet.So yes, how about we go to the thing that I will disclose to you today, the most anticipated thing for which bloggers have held up a considerable measure.Along these lines, clients of BlogSpot have their blessing. That is to say, clients of BlogSpot space who haven’t purchased any custom area. The blessing is: SSL Declaration for their area. Be that as it may, shouldn’t something be said about blogger websites with the custom area? Will they need to hold up additional? No remark. All things considered, see the address bar and you’ll see that Blogger Guider has SSL Authentication, and it is fueled by CloudFlare and along these lines, our blog’s stacking speed has additionally diminished!Along these lines, 1.46s for a 4.6 MB is not terrible. Contrast this and different online journals or sites with comparative page size and you’ll see that they stack slower. That is the impact of, yes, right-CloudFlare. CloudFlare is a CDN benefit which is Allowed to utilize, and will utilize this administration just, with some JavaScripts to move your blogger blog from HTTP to HTTPS and in reward, you’ll get a lift in your blog’s stacking time.Presently, I’d get a kick out of the chance to make this unmistakable in beginning, that, I don’t prescribe utilizing the thing I will share. No, don’t take it that contrarily. I intend to state, I’ve utilized CloudFlare’s free arrange in this post yet, I exceptionally prescribe you utilizing their Ace Arrangement which costs just 20 every month. All things considered, when you have a decent blog + great wage, then interest in right things is likewise imperative.<br><br>Along these lines, without squandering your time, how about we begin!<br><br><h3>            Why Moving To HTTPS Is Necessary Or Recommended?<br>        </h3>Everybody know Google gives a slight lift to the rank of locales which are HTTPS empowered. In any case, slight increment. That is insignificant on the off chance that you inquire me. In any case, the contort most likely is, in future, as indicated by what I have perused up until now, Google will build the impact of this "lift" and that time, you'll be desirous of WordPress locales.<br>So, you’ve got the reason to follow this guide but, let’s<br>first read some important points:<br><br><br><ol><li><br>                Your traffic will be down for few days until Google correctly<br>                indexes all your URLs with HTTPS.<br>            </li><li><br>                During this all process, if you made any mistake, then your<br>                blog can go down for few hours (so, consider doing this all<br>                after 12 AM if you get most of your traffic from India)<br>            </li><li><br>                You’ll have to remove all the widgets that are<br>                hosted/attached to non-SSL hosts.<br>            </li></ol>If it's not too much trouble Note: In case you're not that techy or are new to blogging or terms like "Facilitating," "CDN," then I'll not suggest you going further. Rather, take a gander at this segment. Additionally, I'm not going to expound every one of the things. I'll clarify as it were primary principle things to keep this short guide, short.<br><h3>            Moving From HTTP To HTTPS<br>        </h3>So, let’s start the process. Firstly, we’ll change the<br>default nameservers. In my case, my domain registrar was GoDaddy and<br>so, in this post, I’ve shown the settings of GoDaddy only. If<br>your domain registrar is not same, then see this section of the post.<br><ul><li>Firstly, sign into your domain registrar (in our case,&nbsp;it’s GoDaddy)<br>            </li><li>Open DNS Manager, now open a new tab<br>            </li><li>Open&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/a/sign-up" rel="noopener external nofollow noreferrer noreferer" target="_blank">CloudFlare sign up page</a>&nbsp;and sign up there and then, you’ll get this page:</li><img alt="screenshot_77" border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S6dClvQCM-0/WBmof_ALjEI/AAAAAAAAAz4/kckCMM2TIWQb3KUSw8LVs07Og0cp12M3wCLcB/s1600/screenshot_77_min_min.png" title="screenshot_77">            <br><li>Now, type your domain in the box given and click “Scan<br>                DNS Records.”<br>            </li><li>After about 60 seconds, CloudFlare will complete scanning your<br>                domain’s DNS records, and now you’re ready to do<br>                some manual action.</li><li>                Go to your Domain Registrar’s DNS manager and then, you<br>                have to copy all the DNS records from Registrar’s DNS<br>                manager to CloudFlare DNS manager.</li><li>                It’s easy. You just have to copy all of them, except the<br>                ones that are already on CloudFlare. Just do it one-by-one and<br>                this will get done within some jiffies.</li><li>                Now, for this tutorial, we’re going to use their<br>                “FREE” Plan which is limited to limited SSL<br>                (elaboration- your site will not open up in older Androids and<br>                mobiles).</li><li>                In the next page, you’ll be asked to choose plans. Choose<br>                FREE just for now (we highly recommend Pro Plan)</li><li>                Now, you’ll be given two nameservers, and it’s the<br>                time to place those nameservers on your domain registrars to<br>                enable CloudFlare to get control over the blog.</li><li>                Now, go back to your registrar and find settings to change<br>                nameservers. In GoDaddy, it is- Settings &gt; Nameservers &gt;&nbsp;Manage<br>            </li><br>            <img alt="screenshot_81" border="0" height="295" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zQjHiOVCwR8/WBmofwUOHRI/AAAAAAAAAz8/TleaE-GLuv4D12wUKHszIDmO92vZZJizgCLcB/s640/screenshot_81.png" title="screenshot_81" width="640">            <br>            <img alt="screenshot_82" border="0" height="475" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Mr0WweJu_Dc/WBmca6yeHwI/AAAAAAAAAxo/hkZFRbBIBq40n9KXaPnDfv3QAQvHoQTwQCLcB/s640/screenshot_82-min.png" title="screenshot_82" width="640">            <br><li>Change Nameservers to ones that CloudFlair has given you and<br>                save.

You’ve successfully enabled SSL on your Blogger<br>                blog. Try visiting your blog with “https” followed<br>                by your domain.<br>            </li><li><br>                Now, we have to redirect HTTP version of our domain and all<br>                subdomains from HTTP to https and to do this, “Page<br>                Rules” will help us.<br>            </li><li><br>                Head over the “Page Rules” tab and add three Page<br>                Rules as shown in the images below:<br>            </li><img alt="screenshot_84" border="0" height="373" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sghiR2-cNYo/WBmcbP3073I/AAAAAAAAAxs/yxO5cBkQAUktkvjwjGy14ZES-FdIwhXGwCLcB/s640/screenshot_84-min.png" title="screenshot_84" width="640">            <img alt="screenshot_85" border="0" height="401" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LM5prrwPEvg/WBmcbfcrIVI/AAAAAAAAAxw/m9ttsbB8pwUAtmpzIZYcov28OPIUY8Z8gCLcB/s640/screenshot_85-min.png" title="screenshot_85" width="640">            <img alt="screenshot_86" border="0" height="408" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-phg046qimAs/WBmcbn8mIwI/AAAAAAAAAx0/8qM03atvP1AkLv2Ior9JpdgfH__vWTGxQCLcB/s640/screenshot_86-min.png" title="screenshot_86" width="640">            <br><li><br>                Be sure that these Page Rules are in the same order.<br>            </li><li><br>                Now next step: head over “Firewall” app and from<br>                the “Security Level” card, set it to<br>                “Low” and log out from CloudFlair because now<br>                there’s nothing to do with it.<br>            </li></ul>Now visit your blog. You’ll see that your blog is being<br>redirected to HTTP all the time whether is it a subdomain or the main<br>domain and keeping the directory (characters after the domain). Now,<br>what’s next? You should not forget that the links in your blog do<br>not have “HTTPS” in their starting and to let Google know<br>that you’ve moved to HTTPS and get your new URL indexed faster,<br>you should change all your blog links from HTTP to HTTPS. But, how?<br>It’s a hectic task! But we’ve made it simple.<br><br><br><ul><li><br>                Open your blog’s template HTML<br>            </li><li><br>                Search for `&lt;/head&gt;` and paste following code above it:<br>            </li></ul><blockquote class="tr_bq">&lt;script&gt;<br>(document).ready(function() {$(“a”).each(function() {var i = (this).attr("href");<br>var n = i.replace(                                      http://www.<strong>yourdomain</strong>                                 , "                                      https://www.<strong>yourdomain</strong>");&nbsp;(this).attr(“href”, function() {return n})})});</script>                Now here comes the coding part. Search for the following code                in your template:                <b:include data="‘blog’" name="‘all-head-content’/">                Remove it and below “<head>” paste the                following codes:            <link href="‘https://www.yourdomain" .com favicon.ico’ rel="‘icon’" type="‘image/x-icon’/"><meta content="‘blogger’" name="‘generator’/"><link href="‘https://www.yourdomain" .com feeds posts default’ rel="‘alternate’" title="‘Blogger" guider - atom’ type="‘application/atom+xml’/"><link href="‘https://www.yourdomain" .com feeds posts default?alt="rss’" rel="‘alternate’" title="‘Blogger" guider - rss’ type="‘application/rss+xml’/"><link href="‘https://www.blogger.com/feeds/" blogid posts default’ rel="‘service.post’" title="‘Blogger" guider - atom’ type="‘application/atom+xml’/"><!–[if IE]><script type="“text/javascript”" src="“https://www.blogger.com/static/v1/jsbin/2591933621-ieretrofit.js”"></script><![endif]–><meta expr:content="‘data:blog.url’" name="‘og:url:domain’/"><!–[if IE]> <script> (function() { var html5 =                 (“abbr,article,aside,audio,canvas,datalist,details,” +                 “figure,footer,header,hgroup,mark,menu,meter,nav,output,” +                 “progress,section,time,video”).split(’,’); for (var i = 0; i                 < html5.length; i++) { document.createElement(html5[i]); }                 try { document.execCommand(‘BackgroundImageCache’, false,                 true); } catch(e) {} })(); </script> <![endif]–>                Now, see for any unsecured (without HTTPS) link in your                template and replace them with secured ones if you have found                or alternatively, upload them to your own host.                            Last thing and the most tedious task- if your images are not                SSL certified or are not hosted on SSL compatible or secured                host, then please upload them to any free hosting services like                postimg.org that are SSL enabled and replace those images with                SSL certified images. Once you are done- congrats, you’re                80% done!            Remaining 20% is settings you’re going to do in Google SearchConsole and Robot.txt.                Go to Blogger > Settings > Search preferences >                Crawlers and indexing > Custom robot.txt                            Edit it and use the following code instead of the one                you’re using currently to make it SSL Compatible:            User-agent: Mediapartners-Google                 Disallow:                 User-agent: *                 Disallow: /search                 Allow: /                 Sitemap:                                      https://www.web-development.cf/sitemap.xml                                              Now save it and head over Google Search Console.                            Add your domain in all the following four ways:            http://yourdomain.com                                  https://yourdomain.com                                  http://www.yourdomain.com                                  https://www.yourdomain.com                                              Now after adding the first three and while adding the fourth                one, submit your sitemap. Please note that you are not required                to submit sitemap from every domain I’ve listed above.                Just while adding the last one (https://www.yourdomain.com) submit the sitemap.XML file.                            Now you’re ready, and your blog is fully SSL compatible.                😃                                        Don’t want to do this all and make your hands dirty?                    Hm…so this was a long and techy process. Why you’re willingto do all this when a professional can do this for you? I’vecollected people who will do this work for you at a very reasonablecost. Plus, if you want any kind of information about SSL or about anyother things, you’re welcome to our try our service. You cancontact me here and get your work done within some minutes.            Cons Of This Early Adaption        There are some disadvantages (plus, the solution of them) of using thismethod to move your blog from HTTP to https. These are giving belowfollowed by their solutions:After moving, you’ll not be able to forward any of your                subdomains to any URL –SOLUTION – Suppose you want to redirect fb.yourdomain.com                to facebook.com/yourdomain, then, navigate to CloudFlare DNS                manager and their, add a CNAME with “Name”                subdomain (for fb.yourdomain.com, it will be “FB”)                and with “Value” ghs.google.com. Then, link it to a                blogger blog and redirect that blogger blog to any                blog/website. For example, see contact.bloggerguider.com.                We’ve used this simple trick to redirect                contact.bloggerguider.com to support.bloggerguider.com.                SOLUTION 2 – Use “Page Rules” to forward but                they’re too limited in numbers.            You’ll not be able to move back, and when you try to,                you’ll lose traffic. No solution, this will happen with                any domain.            Simple way -> Short way if you wrong in any steps. Following this my simple guides:1.

In this way, on the off chance that you haven’t yet.<br>So yes, how about we go to the thing that I will disclose to you today, the most anticipated thing for which bloggers have held up a considerable measure.<br><br>Along these lines, clients of BlogSpot have their blessing. That is to say, clients of BlogSpot space who haven’t purchased any custom area. The blessing is: SSL Declaration for their area. Be that as it may, shouldn’t something be said about blogger websites with the custom area? Will they need to hold up additional? No remark. All things considered, see the address bar and you’ll see that Blogger Guider has SSL Authentication, and it is fueled by CloudFlare and along these lines, our blog’s stacking speed has additionally diminished!<br><br><br><img on="tap:lightbox1" role="button" tabindex="0" layout="responsive" width="243" height="45" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1zh7ShICd4Q/WBmcaHeE2UI/AAAAAAAAAxc/MPx11FMNkOk-6f33DduAwufj0-F0xQHMACLcB/s1600/screenshot_71-min.png" alt="Blogger Blog WIth HTTPS (Custom Domain)" title="Blogger Blog WIth HTTPS (Custom Domain)"><br><br><br><img on="tap:lightbox1" role="button" tabindex="0" layout="responsive" width="687" height="195" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FeXB3KNT3h4/V7BYs49T-kI/AAAAAAAAALc/Hpe8OQFxK3QLPXKIHeRMZwyyg1vy2mrCACLcB/s1600/screenshot_72.png" alt="screenshot_72" title="screenshot_72"><br>Along these lines, 1.46s for a 4.6 MB is not terrible.

CloudFlare is a CDN benefit which is Allowed to utilize, and will utilize this administration just, with some JavaScripts to move your blogger blog from HTTP to HTTPS and in reward, you’ll get a lift in your blog’s stacking time.<br><br>Presently, I’d get a kick out of the chance to make this unmistakable in beginning, that, I don’t prescribe utilizing the thing I will share. No, don’t take it that contrarily. I intend to state, I’ve utilized CloudFlare’s free arrange in this post yet, I exceptionally prescribe you utilizing their Ace Arrangement which costs just <span class="katex-error" title="ParseError: KaTeX parse error: Expected &#039;EOF&#039;, got &#039;&amp;&#039; at position 2108: …r (in our case,&amp;̲nbsp;it’s GoDad…">20 every month. All things considered, when you have a decent blog + great wage, then interest in right things is likewise imperative.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Along these lines, without squandering your time, how about we begin!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h3&gt;            Why Moving To HTTPS Is Necessary Or Recommended?&lt;br&gt;        &lt;/h3&gt;Everybody know Google gives a slight lift to the rank of locales which are HTTPS empowered. In any case, slight increment. That is insignificant on the off chance that you inquire me. In any case, the contort most likely is, in future, as indicated by what I have perused up until now, Google will build the impact of this &quot;lift&quot; and that time, you&#039;ll be desirous of WordPress locales.&lt;br&gt;So, you’ve got the reason to follow this guide but, let’s&lt;br&gt;first read some important points:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br&gt;                Your traffic will be down for few days until Google correctly&lt;br&gt;                indexes all your URLs with HTTPS.&lt;br&gt;            &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br&gt;                During this all process, if you made any mistake, then your&lt;br&gt;                blog can go down for few hours (so, consider doing this all&lt;br&gt;                after 12 AM if you get most of your traffic from India)&lt;br&gt;            &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br&gt;                You’ll have to remove all the widgets that are&lt;br&gt;                hosted/attached to non-SSL hosts.&lt;br&gt;            &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;If it&#039;s not too much trouble Note: In case you&#039;re not that techy or are new to blogging or terms like &quot;Facilitating,&quot; &quot;CDN,&quot; then I&#039;ll not suggest you going further. Rather, take a gander at this segment. Additionally, I&#039;m not going to expound every one of the things. I&#039;ll clarify as it were primary principle things to keep this short guide, short.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h3&gt;            Moving From HTTP To HTTPS&lt;br&gt;        &lt;/h3&gt;So, let’s start the process. Firstly, we’ll change the&lt;br&gt;default nameservers. In my case, my domain registrar was GoDaddy and&lt;br&gt;so, in this post, I’ve shown the settings of GoDaddy only. If&lt;br&gt;your domain registrar is not same, then see this section of the post.&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Firstly, sign into your domain registrar (in our case,&amp;nbsp;it’s GoDaddy)&lt;br&gt;            &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open DNS Manager, now open a new tab&lt;br&gt;            &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/a/sign-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferer nofollow&quot;&gt;CloudFlare sign up page&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and sign up there and then, you’ll get this page:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;screenshot_77&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S6dClvQCM-0/WBmof_ALjEI/AAAAAAAAAz4/kckCMM2TIWQb3KUSw8LVs07Og0cp12M3wCLcB/s1600/screenshot_77_min_min.png&quot; title=&quot;screenshot_77&quot;&gt;            &lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now, type your domain in the box given and click “Scan&lt;br&gt;                DNS Records.”&lt;br&gt;            &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After about 60 seconds, CloudFlare will complete scanning your&lt;br&gt;                domain’s DNS records, and now you’re ready to do&lt;br&gt;                some manual action.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;                Go to your Domain Registrar’s DNS manager and then, you&lt;br&gt;                have to copy all the DNS records from Registrar’s DNS&lt;br&gt;                manager to CloudFlare DNS manager.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;                It’s easy. You just have to copy all of them, except the&lt;br&gt;                ones that are already on CloudFlare. Just do it one-by-one and&lt;br&gt;                this will get done within some jiffies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;                Now, for this tutorial, we’re going to use their&lt;br&gt;                “FREE” Plan which is limited to limited SSL&lt;br&gt;                (elaboration- your site will not open up in older Androids and&lt;br&gt;                mobiles).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;                In the next page, you’ll be asked to choose plans. Choose&lt;br&gt;                FREE just for now (we highly recommend Pro Plan)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;                Now, you’ll be given two nameservers, and it’s the&lt;br&gt;                time to place those nameservers on your domain registrars to&lt;br&gt;                enable CloudFlare to get control over the blog.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;                Now, go back to your registrar and find settings to change&lt;br&gt;                nameservers. In GoDaddy, it is- Settings &amp;gt; Nameservers &amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;Manage&lt;br&gt;            &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;            &lt;img alt=&quot;screenshot_81&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;295&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zQjHiOVCwR8/WBmofwUOHRI/AAAAAAAAAz8/TleaE-GLuv4D12wUKHszIDmO92vZZJizgCLcB/s640/screenshot_81.png&quot; title=&quot;screenshot_81&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;            &lt;br&gt;            &lt;img alt=&quot;screenshot_82&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;475&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Mr0WweJu_Dc/WBmca6yeHwI/AAAAAAAAAxo/hkZFRbBIBq40n9KXaPnDfv3QAQvHoQTwQCLcB/s640/screenshot_82-min.png&quot; title=&quot;screenshot_82&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;            &lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Change Nameservers to ones that CloudFlair has given you and&lt;br&gt;                save. Within some time, your CloudFlare account will be ready&lt;br&gt;                and faster.&lt;br&gt;            &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Till now, what you&#039;ve done, or we&#039;ve done is the setup of CloudFlare on our TDL space, and now, the genuine motivation behind this guide starts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Firstly, go to “Crypto” tab and select&lt;br&gt;                “Flexible” from “SSL” card’s&lt;br&gt;                dropdown as shown in the picture below:&lt;br&gt;            &lt;/li&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;screenshot_83&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yr_H3qHXrhI/WBm8qosgGBI/AAAAAAAAA2E/8cBepbZpTOstJOgqoMQeGV9tp9mG5rcJACLcB/s1600/screenshot_83_min-min.png&quot; title=&quot;screenshot_83&quot;&gt;            &lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br&gt;                Congratz! You’ve successfully enabled SSL on your Blogger&lt;br&gt;                blog. Try visiting your blog with “https” followed&lt;br&gt;                by your domain.&lt;br&gt;            &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br&gt;                Now, we have to redirect HTTP version of our domain and all&lt;br&gt;                subdomains from HTTP to https and to do this, “Page&lt;br&gt;                Rules” will help us.&lt;br&gt;            &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br&gt;                Head over the “Page Rules” tab and add three Page&lt;br&gt;                Rules as shown in the images below:&lt;br&gt;            &lt;/li&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;screenshot_84&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;373&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sghiR2-cNYo/WBmcbP3073I/AAAAAAAAAxs/yxO5cBkQAUktkvjwjGy14ZES-FdIwhXGwCLcB/s640/screenshot_84-min.png&quot; title=&quot;screenshot_84&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;            &lt;img alt=&quot;screenshot_85&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;401&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LM5prrwPEvg/WBmcbfcrIVI/AAAAAAAAAxw/m9ttsbB8pwUAtmpzIZYcov28OPIUY8Z8gCLcB/s640/screenshot_85-min.png&quot; title=&quot;screenshot_85&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;            &lt;img alt=&quot;screenshot_86&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;408&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-phg046qimAs/WBmcbn8mIwI/AAAAAAAAAx0/8qM03atvP1AkLv2Ior9JpdgfH__vWTGxQCLcB/s640/screenshot_86-min.png&quot; title=&quot;screenshot_86&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;            &lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br&gt;                Be sure that these Page Rules are in the same order.&lt;br&gt;            &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br&gt;                Now next step: head over “Firewall” app and from&lt;br&gt;                the “Security Level” card, set it to&lt;br&gt;                “Low” and log out from CloudFlair because now&lt;br&gt;                there’s nothing to do with it.&lt;br&gt;            &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Now visit your blog. You’ll see that your blog is being&lt;br&gt;redirected to HTTP all the time whether is it a subdomain or the main&lt;br&gt;domain and keeping the directory (characters after the domain). Now,&lt;br&gt;what’s next? You should not forget that the links in your blog do&lt;br&gt;not have “HTTPS” in their starting and to let Google know&lt;br&gt;that you’ve moved to HTTPS and get your new URL indexed faster,&lt;br&gt;you should change all your blog links from HTTP to HTTPS. But, how?&lt;br&gt;It’s a hectic task!

These are giving below<br>followed by their solutions:<br><ul><li>After moving, you’ll not be able to forward any of your<br>                subdomains to any URL –SOLUTION – Suppose you want to redirect <a target="_blank" href="http://fb.yourdomain.com" rel="noopener external nofollow noreferrer">fb.yourdomain.com</a><br>                to <a target="_blank" href="http://facebook.com/yourdomain" rel="noopener external nofollow noreferrer">facebook.com/yourdomain</a>, then, navigate to CloudFlare DNS<br>                manager and their, add a CNAME with “Name”<br>                subdomain (for <a target="_blank" href="http://fb.yourdomain.com" rel="noopener external nofollow noreferrer">fb.yourdomain.com</a>, it will be “FB”)<br>                and with “Value” <a target="_blank" href="http://ghs.google.com" rel="noopener external nofollow noreferrer">ghs.google.com</a>. Then, link it to a<br>                blogger blog and redirect that blogger blog to any<br>                blog/website. For example, see <a target="_blank" href="http://contact.bloggerguider.com" rel="noopener external nofollow noreferrer">contact.bloggerguider.com</a>.<br>                We’ve used this simple trick to redirect<br>                <a target="_blank" href="http://contact.bloggerguider.com" rel="noopener external nofollow noreferrer">contact.bloggerguider.com</a> to <a target="_blank" href="http://support.bloggerguider.com" rel="noopener external nofollow noreferrer">support.bloggerguider.com</a>.<br><br>                SOLUTION 2 – Use “Page Rules” to forward but<br>                they’re too limited in numbers.<br>            </li><li>You’ll not be able to move back, and when you try to,<br>                you’ll lose traffic.
