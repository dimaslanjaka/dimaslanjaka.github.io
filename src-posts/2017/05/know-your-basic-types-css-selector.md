In the tutorial to know basis             CSS selector I will discuss five basic types selector in CSS.CSS             Selector not only 5 of this type, but in most cases it is             sufficient to create a web page HTML + CSS.         <br><strong>Selector</strong>is a pattern <strong><em>(pattern)</em></strong> used to<em>'find'</em> a tag in the HTML. Analogy for the            <em>selector,</em> for example: <em>search all p tags,</em> or             <em>                search through all the h1 tag that has the attribute class =                 title.             </em>        <br>CSS has many selector, we will discuss one by one:         <br><hr><h3 style="text-align: center;">            universal Selector&nbsp;<img height="179" src="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/learn-css3-selectors-160615004050/95/learn-css3-selectors-6-638.jpg?cb=1473332802" width="320"></h3><strong>Universal selector</strong>            only 1 in CSS, the asterisk "*". Selector aims to <em>'find'</em>            any existing tags.         <br><strong>Universal Selector</strong>            CSS Example:         <br><pre>  * {<br>    color: blue;<br>    background-color: white;<br>   } </pre>CSS code Issuer intends to make the entire HTML tags are blue and             white background.         <br><hr><h3 style="text-align: center;">            Element Type Selector&nbsp;<img height="110" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/WbRcNzKyURvEHJxGprllpX_6ustIXDo4bU8lJGvWD_vyxdlNRjghx5w1fL_bFp3SxE_7efrSAPjeraygRg5Onwaw3uQVdvRKp1hvv2YpGvArGzNNoRN3ZoAYcLYVsdGHjSBAtKwUaeq2=w515-h285-nc" width="200"></h3><strong>Element Type Selector</strong>            or <strong>Tag Selector</strong> is a term for a selector whose             value is HTML tag itself. Each HTML tag can be used as a selector,             and all of those tags will be <em>captured</em> by this selector.         <br>Element Type Selector CSS Example:         <br><pre>  h1 { <br>    text-decoration: underline;<br> }<br><br> p { <br>   font-size: 14px;<br>   } </pre>CSS code example above will make all<strong>&lt;h1&gt;</strong>            will be underlined, and the rest of the <strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong>            will be sized 14pixel.         <br>The effects of type selector element is from the beginning of the             tag, until the end of the tag. If within the &lt;p&gt; tag are             &lt;i&gt;, then the tag will also be a 14 pixel, until encountered             closing &lt;/ p&gt;.         <br><hr><h3 style="text-align: center;">            Class Selector&nbsp;<img src="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQQ15ICR7XXcNa7gdWv5Ar-SuVb2l1gZE70JgQ2WYk8RqslniciDg"></h3><strong>Class</strong>            selector <strong>Selector</strong> is one of the most common and             most frequently used. <em>Class Selector</em> will <em>'find'</em>            the entire tag has a <em>class</em> attribute with <em>the</em>            appropriate <em>value.</em>        <br>To use <strong>Class Selector,</strong> we should have a HTML tag             that has a <em>class</em> attribute.Example:         <br><pre>  &lt;P class = "paragraf_pertama"&gt; This is a first paragraph &lt;/ p&gt;<br><br> &lt;H1 class = "title"&gt; Article Title &lt;/ h1&gt;<br><br> &lt;H2 class = "important title color"&gt; Sub Title Pages &lt;h2&gt; </pre>Note that for all the tags above, we add the <em>class</em>            attribute to its value is the name of the class itself.             <strong>                A class name can be owned by more than one tag, and a tag can                 have more than one class.             </strong>        <br>For example, in the last line in the example above,<strong>h2</strong> tag has the attribute            <em>class = "colored important title".</em> This tag teridiri of 3 class, the <em>title</em> <em>is important,</em>and the            <em>colored class.</em>        <br>As for the Class Selector CSS code is as follows:         <br><pre>  .paragraf_pertama {<br>                   color: red;<br>                   }<br><br> .judul { <br>        font-size: 20px;<br>        } </pre><pre>  .penting { <br>        color: red;<br>        font-size: 1em;<br>        } </pre>To use a <strong>class selector,</strong> in CSS we use<strong>a dot</strong> before the name of the            <strong>class.</strong>        <br>For our example, the entire class that has the value            <em>"paragraf_pertama",</em> the text color will be red. And the             whole class <em>titles</em> will have 20 pixel font.         <br><hr><h3 style="text-align: center;">            ID Selector&nbsp;<img height="112" src="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT9WzUkN39TLW0xpPuD66ixRDKgdbUHns6sECezdgfMx1litge2brUmU7lR" width="200"></h3><strong>ID Selector</strong>together with a <strong>class selector</strong> is most common            <strong>selector</strong> and also frequently used (although not as often as <em>the class selector).</em> Use of the            <em>ID selector</em> is almost the same as the class selector, with             the Class Selector difference if we use the <strong>class</strong>            attribute for HTML tags, for the <strong>ID selector,</strong> we             use <strong>the id attribute.</strong>        <br>Examples of the use of <strong>the id attribute</strong>to the HTML             tag         <br><pre>  &lt;P id = "paragraf_pembuka"&gt; This is an introductory paragraph &lt;/ p&gt;<br><br> &lt;H1 id = "judul_utama"&gt; Article Title &lt;/ h1&gt;<br><br> &lt;H2 id = "sub_judul"&gt; Sub Title Pages &lt;h2&gt; </pre>Id attributes in addition to CSS selector, also serves as a unique             code to each tag (mainly used to code JavaScript).Because of this,             id used must be unique and should not match. In other words,             <strong>                the id can only be used one time in a web page and can not be                 same.             </strong>        <br>Examples of the use of the id selector Class Selector CSS code is             as follows:         <br><pre>  #paragraf_ opener {<br>                    color: red;<br>                    }<br><br> The main #judul { <br>              font-size: 20px<br>              } </pre>In the CSS code, we use the <strong>hashtag</strong> "#" as a sign             that we are looking for a tag with the <strong>id.</strong>        <br><hr><h3 style="text-align: center;">            attribute Selector&nbsp;<img height="182" src="https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQhYiOGMn9s4erPKi6UTMt-8_2OXW0I3EmaggAt0tg1k7OfFR0bueSbvylB" width="200"></h3>Our final basic Selector is <strong>a selector attribute.</strong>            Selector is a little more<em>advanced</em> than the previous             selector-selector. Attribute Selector is used to search through all             the tags that have the attributes that are written.         <br>Examples of the use Attribute Selector CSS code is as follows:         <br><pre> [Href] {font-size: 20px;  } [Type = "submit"] {width: 30px;  } </pre>As can be seen from the above examples, each            <strong>attribute selectors</strong> must be between square             brackets "[" and "]".         <br><strong>[href]</strong>            will match all tags that have the<strong>href</strong> attribute,             whatever the value of the<strong>href</strong> (usually found on the tag href <strong>&lt;a&gt;).</strong>For example<strong>[type = "submit"]</strong> will match a tag with            <em>a type attribute</em> with a value <em>submit,</em> which in             this case is the<em>submit</em> button on the <em>form.</em>        <br>Although it has the ability to search for very specific tag, but            <strong>an attribute selector</strong> is not overused.         <br><hr>Besides the five selectors basis of the above, the CSS still has a             selector that is more <em>'remote'</em> in selecting tags to be             manipulated, but one example, such&nbsp;<strong>pseudo selector</strong>are used for each event of link, known as the effect            <strong>mouseover,</strong>that we look for the condition at the time of a mouse is above a certain tag.            <strong>Pseudo Selector</strong> will be discussed on another             occasion.         <br>That's the basis of the CSS selector 5, which in addition to             stand-alone, can also be combined with other selectors for more             specific purposes. The incorporation of this selector will be             discussed in the next tutorial             <a href="http://www.webmanajemen.com/p/search.html?q=how%20to%20use%20css%20selector" title="Edit &quot;Learning CSS Tutorial Part 6: How to Use CSS Selector&quot;" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow">                How to Use CSS Selector</a>.         </div></div>
