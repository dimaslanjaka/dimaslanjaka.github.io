            This guide is brought to you by a self-proclaimed Seven Knights 1
            and 2 veteran player 🤣. Seven Knights is a game with many
            fascinating heroes that I grew fond of. My favorites are the
            crusader heroes Shane, Sieg, Nia, and Rury.
        </p>

            ^ If you click that, you will see Sieg from SK2. My first awakening
            hero in SK1 😄

                The guide looks much messier when viewed through the app on the

            <strong>

            <strong>This game is </strong>
            <em><strong>great</strong></em>
            <strong> and very friendly for f2p.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Storyline is beautiful, and the gameplay encourages the user to
                control their team as you progress in the difficulty.
            </strong>
            It's a pity that so many people quit after 5 minutes of tutorial,
            just because there is an auto mode 😞
        </p>
        <p>
            (plus, you gotta have auto for convenience in a MOBILE game! So
            many more people would quit if EVERYTHING was manual and
            repetitive.. I would not want to drown in extensive controlling
            after a long day of work...)
            <strong>
                Eventually, the game gets challenging enough that it's as if
                the auto isn't there.
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Gacha is actually very f2p friendly, especially with the pity
            system. I played kr server without the pity system for half a year,
            because the gameplay made up for it.
        </p>

            Anyway, enough ranting. We will get started.

            <strong>How to invest rubies</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Rubies can be gained from completing scenarios, weekly
                    seasonal pvp awards, and field of exploration. Other than
                    seven knights 1, I haven't had a game that gives out this
                    much free in-game currency!
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <em>Priority:</em>
                    <strong>
                        Rate up hero summons (NOT special summons) until level
                        50 ~ 60, then from there invest all in masteries.
                    </strong>
                    Unlock masteries for free until level 50 ~ 60, then invest
                    all rubies until you unlock all. Masteries are important
                    and leveling becomes much slower as you level.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Rate up heroes change every 2 weeks, if I remember
                    correctly. The rate up banners have a deadline date
                    indicating the time left for the rate up on that specific
hero.                    <strong>This gauge RESETS when the deadline comes,</strong>
                    so make sure you get it before the rate up hero changes.
                    Special summons and select hero summons do not have
                    deadlines and do not reset even if the hero is changed.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Do not,</strong>
            <em>do not do not do not</em>
            use rubies on pets and gear summons.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Use rubies on hero summons (rate up heroes if possible, and
                    not special summon because <strong>special summons</strong>
                    (Currently Cosette) have a
                    <strong>
                        much lower chance of acquisition compared to rate up
                        banners).
                    </strong>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Pet summons are not worth it. Trust me, I speak from experience
                playing this game for 9 months.
            </strong>
            VERY high risk for high gain, but the rates are low so it might as
            well be VERY high risk and no return.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Gear summons are just useless and waste of rubies.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Summary: Focus on getting heroes first, then invest in
                    masteries with rubies at a later time, some time in level
                    50~60.

                So what are moonstones, and how should I obtain and use my

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    As for select hero summons, they require moonstones which
                    can be obtained from 4 man single/party raids starting from
                    level 10 for single and level 6 for party.

            <li>
                <p>
                    Select hero tickets can be used instead of moonstones,
                    which can be purchased at the topaz store.

        <p>
            <strong>Main source of topaz comes from PvP,</strong>
            largely from daily competition modes and guild wars.

            None, but you will need to raise them anyway for the codex buff
            (explained in detail later). Codex buff takes account all heroes;
            this means you need to max level heroes you don't use too, so do
            not be tempted to fuse hero shards until you lv 50 max out the
            hero.

            <li>
                <p>
                    Lene can be used in the beginning for the Giganteus boss
                    raid suppression. Rare+ Lene will take over eventually,
                    though.

            <strong>Greater tier (Green):</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Ian, Adel, Guilahan, Henry, Scott. They all have status
                    effect resistance passive. Once you get to normal
                    difficulty, you will realize that burns from mobs hurt a
                    lot, so get your Guilahan ready.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>I recommend using Adel as the main tanker</strong>
            before you get Kade, or even legendary Rudy/Evan. Rudy is the
            better tank over Evan in terms of all roundedness.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    I also recommend using Ian on boss stages that hurt a lot,
                    as he has a skill that reduces the damage dealt on your
                    team.

        <p>
            Don't pick Shane or Rudy, you get them as account combat power
            rewards. If you already picked them, it's fine. You are going to
            gacha a lot anyway. I recommend getting Shay or Cosette.

            <strong>Rare tier (Blue):</strong>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Most healers are in this tier. You will eventually use most
                    healers though as there will be a 8 man raid released in
                    the future that requires you to use solely healers to
                    defeat the raid boss. Keep that in mind.

                <p>
                    Shay is always 0 tier since she refills all ally's ult
                    gauge.

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Shay</strong>
                    recovers ult gauge for allies, <strong>Lukey</strong> (rare
+, not white) boosts movement/attack speed of allies, and                    <strong>Serena</strong> reduces/resets ally skill cooldown.
                    <strong>
                        Thus, Serena, Shay, and Lukey (blue +) go extremely
                        well together
                    </strong>
                    and are referred to as the engine deck.
                </p>

                        This deck is useful for fast wave clear like gold
                        dungeon and field of exploration.

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
I recommend giving Lukey<strong>Crit/Skill level up,</strong> Shay                    <strong>cooldown</strong>, serena <strong>attack</strong>
                    gear.

            <li>
                <p>
                    As such, with Serena, Shay, and Lukey, you have a frontline
                    choice that is up to you.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    +@ frontline: if you want more damage, go for tanky dps
                    like Rachel. She is great. If you want more tank, then
                    legendary Rudy is also very great in the engine deck.

            <em>Rare Shane and Rudy</em>

            replaced by the legendary + versions eventually.

            Similarly,
            <em>

            but they will be replaced eventually by their legendary hero

                        Reason for putting healer in front in late-game is
                        because your healer is tanky enough to act as a tank.

                    This allows you to take out a tank and put one more
                    DPS/ranged to do more damage over time.

                These are all example heroes that can work well in PvP
                together. That is not to say these decks are perfect and
                definitive. I have laid out these decks as an example because
                many people have questioned how to arrange PvP decks. Please
                play around and see what works best for you. Make sure you
                adjust masteries based on your deck style. For example, an
                offensive deck would require all offensive masteries, a
                defensive deck would require all defensive masteries, and etc.

            <strong>GROWTH DUNGEONS</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            You will receive extra growth dungeon tickets from field of
            exploration. Save them and use when you clear level 10 of each
            growth dungeon. However, soulstone quarry is a little unique. Use
            them at a moderate amount even before completing level 10 since you
            need to raise all your heroes at all points in your journey. Try to
            clear level 10 on soul quarry the fastest so then you can use your
            tickets with the best efficiency.

                    Now the most important dungeon to clear fast is soulstone
quarry because they help you                    <strong>transcend your heroes' max level.</strong> The deck
                    I recommend for fastest clear is:

                    <em>A tank</em>
                    (preferably Rachel, if not Kade) for they both have defense
                    break and debuffs.

                    is your friend in clearing these dungeons. Play around with

                    Make sure that you always
                    <strong>
                        clear the highest level (rare soulstones are much less
                        prioritized)
                    </strong>
                    , because legendary soulstones are scarce all throughout
                    the game.

                    There are also legendary soulstones you can buy in the
Alice soulstone store.                    <strong>Don't buy them with rubies</strong> unless you are
                    a heavy, heavy whale. And even whales shouldn't buy them
                    lol. <strong>Very inefficient.</strong>

                    As you progress into higher levels of soulstone dungeon,
                    you will need to put your tank on one side of the dungeon
                    and the rest of your team on the other side. The golem
                    directs an AoE attack facing the direction of the
                    frontline.

                    You have to raise all heroes eventually since they
                    contribute to hero codex buff. You just need to prioritize
                    which heroes to raise first based on their utility.

                    Use close ranged heroes because the bird boss will use an
                    AoE attack if a hero is within a certain range away from
                    the boss. You can follow the PvE deck here as well. You
                    will see this in the beginning of the video, he shows what
                    happens when heroes are too far away from the bird.

                    Currently in the works. This section will show which heroes
                    are best for each chapter boss.

            <li>
                <p>
                    Generally, bosses face the frontline hero. Use this to your
                    advantage,
                    <strong>
                        take your frontline to the opposite side and make the
                        boss face away from the rest of your team.
                    </strong>
                    If you go too far from the boss, then the boss will start
                    attacking your team instead. When the boss uses an AoE, use
                    the gather button to safely relocate your team.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Repeat this technique; if the boss starts attacking a
                    different hero, then you will have to control that
                    character instead and act as a frontline.

                    In the meantime, I recommend using Karin (reduces attack
                    power of opponent) + Ian (reduces damage of opponent) for
                    difficult bosses that hurt a lot. For example, Pasma is a
                    boss in chapter 8 that many users get stuck on, so I
                    recommend using Ian + a healer to greatly reduce the damage
                    the boss deals to your team.

        <p>
Before we discuss about equipment, let me introduce you to            <em>presets.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Presets:</strong>
            <em>
                Presets are available for PvP and PvE excluding field of
                exploration and scenarios.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    This system allows you to save your deck information
                    concering heroes, pet, equipment, and formation.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    You can easily edit these as your deck changes over time.
                    All you have to do is simply go in the content you wish to
                    access your preset controls in.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    You will see New Team and Saved Team. Click on saved team,
                    and you will be able to create many presets for each
                    content.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    There are also mini presets that allow you to save
                    equipment sets when you go inside the inventory tab. The
                    button is present next to your hero information.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Use this feature well, it will make your life much easier
                    than swapping equipment between heroes.
                </p>

        <hr>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Start by replacing equipment from common to greater, then
                    greater to rare. You will slowly replace all low-tier
                    equipment to rare, while you work on your legendary gears.

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    As you work your way to legendary gears, I recommend only
                    <strong>
                        enhancing rare equipment (not common or greater), and
                        when you do, enhance only to +10 max. Any enhancement
                        levels above +10 is not worth it
                    </strong>
                    because you are going to not use them in the future.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Do not transcend common and greater gears. You should
                    transcend gears indefinitely on rare gears and up.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Equip the gears you no longer use to heroes that do not
                    have gears.
                    <strong>
                        Equipping gear on all of your heroes will raise your
                        account's combat power. This will help you receive
                        account combat power rewards faster.

                        Craft legendary weapons first (raid gives you the
                        materials), then armors. You can craft gear through
                        materials earned from raids.

        <p>
            <strong>Don't craft accessories</strong>

                        through crafting. Radiant gear is hard to come by,
                        focus on just getting regular legendary gears finished

        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>DPS/Ranged = Crit 5 set</strong>

            <strong>
                Status effect Resistance heroes = Mercenary set (All skill
                level up) = Heroes such as Scott, Guilahan, usually for
                universal/defense frontline heroes

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
As for legendary equipment to complete first, create                    <strong>5 set of crit for your dps,</strong> prioritize
                    making the <strong>weapon +20 and 5 transcend,</strong> and
                    don't get too hung up on making the armor +20. You won't
                    have enough enhancement stones anyway. Radiant sets are
                    better, but you will focus on aiming for these in the far,
                    far future.

            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Save up yellow enhancement stones</strong>
                    for at least enhancement levels +13 and above because these
                    are rare to come by. Before that, use rare/legendary (red)
                    stones to upgrade according to your best judgment.

            <strong>What to do with raid equipment selection box?:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            As for <strong>raid material selection box</strong>, always go for
            the <em>mercenary token</em>. You can't get these materials in any
            of the raids so they are the hardest equipment set (mercenary set)
            to make.

            <strong>Methods to raise codex buff:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>1)Proficiency levels</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>These determine your account's power the most.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            These contribute to the codex stat buffs at the greatest degree, in
            addition to the soulstones you get for each proficiency level.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each hero has proficiency levels which can be raised in all
            contents in the game except scenarios.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each content gives proficiency exp, with the majority of exp
            farming done in field of exploration and 8 man party raids (since 8
            &gt; 4 man raids, more can get exp from 8 man).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>DPS and ranged give </strong>
            <em><strong>attack power stats</strong></em>
            <strong> to your codex buff</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Defense gives </strong>
            <em><strong>defense stats</strong></em>
            <strong> to your codex buff</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Universal and support give </strong>
            <em><strong>health stats</strong></em>
            <strong> to your codex buff</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Highest tier heroes</strong>
            give more stats to codex buff.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Prioritize farming proficiencies in this order: DPS/ranged

            <strong>How to gain proficiency exp:</strong>
            <em>IMPORTANT! Please read.</em>

            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Clear recharge tickets are greatest and fastest ways to
                        farm for proficiency exp in a short amount of time.
                    </strong>
                    They can be obtained through in-app purchases or
                    events/pushes. These tickets are yellow and have a timer
                    drawing on it.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    You can use these tickets in growth dungeons and all single
mode raids, but                    <strong>I recommend using these in 8 man raids</strong>
                    since you are able to farm for more proficiency exp with
                    the most amount of heroes (eight) as opposed to 4 heroes
                    for 4 man raids and growth dungeons.
                </p>
            </li>

                        You are also given free 10 clear recharge daily as a
                        default.
                    </strong>
                    You can see a yellow T 10/10 every time you enter a
                    raid/growth dungeon. Remember, these are distinctive and
                    unique to clear recharge tickets (yellow timer) I mentioned
                    above. On top of these, you can
                    <strong>
                        use 50 rubies to purchase up to 5 clear recharges,
                    </strong>
                    which equals to 250 rubies per day should you wish to raise
                    more proficiency exp this way.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
You can use 8 man single raids (                    <strong>clear recharge tickets,</strong> they look like
                    yellow timer tickets) as a great source in raising
proficiency levels. I highly recommend                    <strong>using clear recharge tickets</strong> once you
                    clear the
                    <strong>
                        10th tier (level) (obviously, more proficiency exp for
                        higher tiers cleared)
                    </strong>
                    of the 8-man single raid.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Each and every content (excluding scenarios) gives you
                    proficiency exp on the heroes you use. Proficiency levels
                    are crucial to account power, and can alternatively be
                    gained slowly and consistently in the field of exploration.

                <p>
                    Potentials and hero levels are the next in line of
                    importance for hero codex stat buffs.
                </p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    As for potentials,
                    <em>
                        prioritize getting all heroes potentials to 6 attack
                        power, 6 health, and 6 defense, starting with
                        dps/ranged heroes from higher grade down.
                    </em>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    This is because potentials affect codex buff every 9 points
                    invested in potentials of each hero. (6x3 = 18). Investing
                    this way is the most cost efficient method than doing
                    something like 12/6/0.

                <p>
                    You can raise them in field of exploration or through exp
                    potions. Hero level max cap can be transcended/raised
                    through soulstones in soulstone dungeons.

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    For each field of exploration stages you should see the
                    obtainable core items displayed before you enter.

            <strong>What to farm first?</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    I recommend farming in fields with main rewards: crit gears
                    (rare grade is fine too) in the beginning, and as you
                    advance on to normal mode, move on to farming for
                    accessories (don't worry, you still get gear in the fields
                    while you farm for accessories). Accessories are important
                    in PvP and PvE.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Farm for <strong>4 pieces of forgotten enraged vow</strong>
                    (accessory that grants immortality to the equipped hero)
and once you have that move on to                    <strong>8 pieces forgotten immortality vow</strong>
                    (accessory that resurrects the equipped hero). These are
                    core accessories for PvP.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    In the field of exploration, I recommend putting
                    <strong>
                        1 healer, 1 tank, and 2 damage dealers (either dps or
                        ranged) starting from the highest grade heroes.
                    </strong>
                    Higher grade heroes give you more health/defense/attack
                    power to your hero codex stat buff than lower grade heroes
                    as you raise their proficiency level. I recommend watching
                    this official sk2 video as they explain more about this:

            <strong>Miscellaneous: Hero and Pet shard fusion:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                As for pet shards, always try to fuse to get higher grade
                shards.
            </strong>
            Pet shards are excess shards that are distinctive to your actual
            pet, meaning that you should be using them to obtain higher grade
            pet shards.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                As for heroes, I don't recommend fusing to get higher grade
                shards
            </strong>
            because 1) Hero levels also affect your codex buff 2) the max cap
            will eventually extend to 56 for you guys, and 60 eventually (KR is
            getting this lv 60 patch for their 1st anniversary). It is fine to
            fuse common and greater hero shards once you 50 level cap them
            though, since they are easy to come by with gacha.
