## Support
Creating a quality Website takes a lot of time. Unlike others website,
Web-Nary is completely independently funded. We fight for our users. This does mean
however that we also have to spend time working contracts to pay the bills.
This is where you can help: by chipping in you can ensure more time is spent
improving Web-Nary rather than dealing with distractions.

To Support Us :-
- You can Contribute
 OR
- You can donate us in our PayPal
