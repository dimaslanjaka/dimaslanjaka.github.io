<p><a href="https://kinsta.com/learn/page-speed/#slow-how-slow">According to a study</a>, <strong>46%</strong> of users don’t revisit a poorly performing site. Hence, it’s common for ecommerce sites to miss out on potential sales due to performance issues. If you haven’t optimized your site for performance, you can lose even more during <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/ecommerce-strategies/#optimize">high seasonal traffic</a> days such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p>
<p>While you can use many techniques to <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/speed-up-woocommerce/">speed up your ecommerce site</a>, quickly solving a pressing performance issue is challenging. It requires proactive monitoring of the site’s overall environment. That’s where an <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/apm-tools/">application performance monitoring tool</a> like <a href="https://kinsta.com/apm-tool/">Kinsta APM</a> can be super helpful.</p>
<p>In this article, you’ll learn about the various components of an ecommerce site, why you need an APM tool to monitor your ecommerce site’s performance, and how you can use Kinsta APM to stay on top of your WooCommerce site’s performance.</p>

<h2>The Various Components of an Ecommerce Site</h2>
<p>To run an ecommerce site at optimal performance, all the pieces matter. From its hosting infrastructure and ecommerce platform to its third-party integrations and the checkout process, everything counts!</p>

<p>Whether you’re selling <a href="https://kinsta.com/clients/honest-brew/">craft beers</a> or <a href="https://www.dartdrones.com/">drone training courses</a>, an <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/ecommerce-platforms/">ecommerce platform</a> like WooCommerce makes it a piece of cake to quickly set up and launch an online store.</p>
<p>Its various extensions also make it super simple to extend the store’s functionality with many essential components.</p>
<figure id="attachment_84544" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84544" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-84544" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ecommerce-Site-Components-Complexity.png" alt="The various components of an ecommerce store" width="690" height="512" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ecommerce-Site-Components-Complexity.png 690w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ecommerce-Site-Components-Complexity-300x223.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-84544" class="wp-caption-text">Tracking various ecommerce components is complex</figcaption></figure>
<p>The more links there are in a chain, the harder it is to find the defective joint when an issue arises. All this complexity can lead to increased performance and availability problems. It affects your capability to respond quickly to performance issues and fix them before they impact your customers.</p>
<p>The solution? Using an <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/application-performance-monitoring/">application performance monitoring</a> tool.</p>
<p>We’ve explicitly designed Kinsta APM to monitor the performance of WordPress sites, including <a href="https://kinsta.com/woocommerce-hosting/">WooCommerce stores hosted at Kinsta</a>.</p>

<h2>The Benefits of Using Kinsta APM for WooCommerce Sites</h2>
<p><kinsta-video src="https://kinsta.wistia.com/medias/7aq1dfoysx"></kinsta-video></p>
<p>Your WooCommerce site’s performance issues can cause significant damage to your online business in multiple ways. You can use Kinsta APM to prevent or overcome these problems. Some of its many benefits include:</p>
<h3>Increases Sales and Revenue</h3>
<p>Performance is critical for an ecommerce site’s bottom line. Maintaining a performant site requires an understanding of many metrics and <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/sysadmin/">DevOps skills</a>. Kinsta APM makes this task easier for you and your staff. As a result, the impact on sales and revenue is the most significant benefit of using Kinsta APM.</p>
<h3>Betters User Experience</h3>
<p>It’s challenging to gauge your users’ satisfaction, as they may go away silently when faced with a speed or performance issue. What’s worse is that they may go to your competitor’s site. A useful APM tool like Kinsta APM gives you the performance insights you need to make sure that your customers are happy and satisfied with your WooCommerce store.</p>
<h3>Curtails Damage to Brand Reputation</h3>
<p>Words travel pretty fast in the digital era. Users no longer wonder whether your ecommerce site performs perfectly. They expect it. So, when they’re interrupted due to site slowdowns or outages, you don’t just lose a sale, but also your brand’s reputation and trust. Kinsta APM can reduce its chances by helping you to keep your site performing at its best.</p>
<h3>Increases Productivity and Happiness</h3>
<p>A better performing site translates to improved internal staff productivity too. For instance, your development team doesn’t have to spend as much time addressing performance issues. The support staff doesn’t have to manage as many tickets. Your marketing team can get more campaigns done in less time. Everyone is more productive and happy when the site is tuned to perform well.</p>
<h3>Frees up Time for Innovation</h3>
<p>Experimenting with innovative strategies to drive business growth is one of the cornerstones of <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/ecommerce-strategies/">ecommerce marketing</a>. Whether you’re a developer or a marketer, Kinsta APM’s simplicity drives collaboration, fostering effective business growth strategies. It also enables faster problem resolution, resulting in the rollout of new features with greater confidence.</p>
<h3>Decreases Hosting and IT Infrastructure Costs</h3>
<p>By identifying performance bottlenecks that would otherwise go undetected, Kinsta APM helps you squeeze the most out of your hosting infrastructure. It enables you to fine-tune your WooCommerce site to scale your website better. Furthermore, by identifying troublesome plugins, extensions, and third-party services, Kinsta APM sets you on the right path towards cutting non-performing IT assets.</p>
<h2>How to Fix WooCommerce Performance Issues with Kinsta APM</h2>
<p>It’s now time to check some real-world examples and explore how you can use Kinsta APM to fix WooCommerce performance issues.</p>
<h3>Learn the Basics of Kinsta APM</h3>
<p>First things, first! Before you dive deep into troubleshooting your WooCommerce site with Kinsta APM, it’s necessary to learn its various terminologies and how you read its insights. You can refer to our <a href="https://kinsta.com/help/apm-tool/#apm-tool-terminology">Kinsta APM knowledgebase</a> to get started.</p>
<p>If you have more questions about Kinsta APM, I suggest you read the <a href="https://kinsta.com/help/apm-tool/#kinsta-apm-faq">Kinsta APM FAQ</a> section.</p>
<h3>The Test WooCommerce Site and Setup</h3>
<p>Kinsta APM works only with <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/why-use-wordpress/">WordPress sites</a> hosted at Kinsta. For this article, I set up a test WooCommerce site to simulate online stores’ most common performance issues. I used an actual <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/choose-domain-name/">domain name</a> to ensure that an <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/tls-vs-ssl/#how-do-tls-and-ssl-work-to-secure-data">SSL/TSL handshake</a> takes place.</p>
<p>Below are the test site’s details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Server Stack: Nginx 1.19.4, PHP 7.3.24-3, MariaDB 5.5.5</li>
<li>WordPress Version: WordPress 5.5.3</li>
<li>Theme: <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/fastest-wordpress-theme/#astra">Astra Theme</a> 2.6.1</li>
<li>Primary Plugins: WooCommerce 4.7.1, <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/abandoned-cart-email/#cart-abandonment-emails-in-woocommerce">WooCommerce Cart Abandonment Recovery</a>, Kinsta Must-use Plugins, and Akismet Anti-spam.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I customized the site slightly using custom plugins to illustrate unique examples. The primary aim here is to teach how you can use Kinsta APM in various situations to troubleshoot several WooCommerce performance issues.</p>
<h3>1. WooCommerce APM Example: Sluggish Third-Party API Calls During Checkout</h3>
<p>Most ecommerce sites rely on third-party integrations to take care of critical processes such as payments and shipments. Many WooCommerce sites also use third-party plugins like <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-use-mailchimp/">Mailchimp</a> and <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/mailchimp-alternatives/#2-mailerlite">MailerLite</a> for email marketing.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/third-party-performance/">third-party services</a> can have a significant impact on your WooCommerce site’s performance. And if it’s affecting your checkout process, then you should take it even more seriously.</p>
<figure id="attachment_84571" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84571" style="width: 1100px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-84571 size-full" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Stripe-API-Outage-Jul-10-2019.png" alt="Stripe API down tweets from the Stripe Status account" width="1100" height="662" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Stripe-API-Outage-Jul-10-2019.png 1100w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Stripe-API-Outage-Jul-10-2019-300x181.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Stripe-API-Outage-Jul-10-2019-1024x616.png 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Stripe-API-Outage-Jul-10-2019-768x462.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-84571" class="wp-caption-text">Stripe’s API faced a major outage last year</figcaption></figure>
<p>In this example, the site took too long to respond whenever a user added a product to their cart. Sometimes, the site took over 5 seconds to respond. That’s a perfect recipe for <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/shopping-cart-abandonment/">shopping cart abandonment</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s fire up Kinsta APM to diagnose the problem.</p>
<p>To get started, go to your site’s <a href="https://kinsta.com/MyKinsta">MyKinsta dashboard</a>, and then head over to the <strong>Monitoring</strong> section.</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Enable</strong> button under the <strong>Performance monitoring</strong> section to let Kinsta APM collect your site’s performance metrics.</p>
<figure id="attachment_84553" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84553" style="width: 1100px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-84553 size-full" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Enable-MyKinsta-Dashboard.jpg" alt="WooCommerce APM - MyKinsta" width="1100" height="474" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Enable-MyKinsta-Dashboard.jpg 1100w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Enable-MyKinsta-Dashboard-300x129.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Enable-MyKinsta-Dashboard-1024x441.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Enable-MyKinsta-Dashboard-768x331.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-84553" class="wp-caption-text">Enabling Kinsta APM in MyKinsta dashboard</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you’d enabled Kinsta APM before (as here), you can see past performance data for that period displayed in the chart and table.</p>
<p>After enabling Kinsta APM, I tested the site and waited for the performance metrics to populate in the Kinsta APM dashboard.</p>
<p>Ideally, wait at least 5 minutes before you dig into the data. It’ll ensure that Kinsta APM has collected enough performance data to present actionable results.</p>

<p>The <strong>Stack trace</strong> section helps you identify all the processes involved in making this HTTP request. Here, we can see that <strong>WC_Form_Handler::add_to_cart_action</strong> is engaged. Further up, we see that it also involves a non-core WordPress script called <strong>payment-api.php</strong>.</p>
<p>Note these down as evidence. However, there’s one more span we have to investigate.</p>
<p>Let’s see the details about it.</p>
<figure id="attachment_84570" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84570" style="width: 1100px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-84570" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slow-Payment-API-Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-2.jpg" alt="‘Span details’ for a PHP script run by a plugin" width="1100" height="745" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slow-Payment-API-Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-2.jpg 1100w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slow-Payment-API-Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-2-300x203.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slow-Payment-API-Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-2-1024x694.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slow-Payment-API-Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-2-768x520.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-84570" class="wp-caption-text">‘Span details’ for a PHP script run by a plugin</figcaption></figure>
<p>Kinsta APM shines the most here. It digs into all the processes related to this span, and then it gives some context to it. You can see that it’s a PHP script/function named <strong>update_card_payment</strong> inside the <strong>payment-api</strong> plugin.</p>
<p>You’ve bagged enough evidence now to make a sound judgment about where to begin your troubleshooting process.</p>
<p>I’d follow this diagnosis by looking into the <strong>payment-api</strong> plugin, specifically for a PHP script or function called <strong>update_card_payment</strong>.</p>
<p>If you or your staff don’t have the technical expertise to fix these issues, you can <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/hire-wordpress-developer/">hire a WordPress developer</a> to look into them.</p>
<p>Next, I’d contact the plugin author to look into their payment API, as it’s responding super slow. Kinsta APM can nudge you in the right direction to identify the root cause of a performance issue quickly. What you do with this knowledge is up to you!</p>

<h3>2. WooCommerce APM Example: Slow WooCommerce Admin Dashboard</h3>
<p>An online store’s backend performance is just as crucial as its frontend performance. While a <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/speed-up-woocommerce/#optimizing-woocommerce-admin-panel">slow WooCommerce admin dashboard</a> can negatively impact your productivity, a faster backend can increase your efficiency in managing everyday tasks and how quickly you respond to customer orders.</p>
<p>Having an efficient WooCommerce dashboard also enables you to do more essential things for your <a href="https://kinsta.com/learn/woocommerce-guide/">online store’s success</a>, like digital marketing.</p>
<figure id="attachment_84573" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84573" style="width: 1100px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-84573" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/WooCommerce-4.0-Updated-Dashboard.png" alt="WooCommerce 4.0 introduced a streamlined dashboard for easy store management" width="1100" height="662" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/WooCommerce-4.0-Updated-Dashboard.png 1100w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/WooCommerce-4.0-Updated-Dashboard-300x181.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/WooCommerce-4.0-Updated-Dashboard-1024x616.png 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/WooCommerce-4.0-Updated-Dashboard-768x462.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-84573" class="wp-caption-text">WooCommerce 4.0 introduced a streamlined dashboard</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ideally, <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/speed-up-woocommerce/#frontend-optimizations-first-backend-optimizations-second">backend optimizations start with frontend optimizations</a>, as in most cases speeding up the frontend fixes performance issues on the backend too. With Kinsta APM, you no longer have to rely on guesswork such as this. You’ll get to see the exact performance data for the entire site, helping you fix any performance issue.</p>
<p>In this example, the admin dashboard is sluggish for the admin and store managers. That’s not ideal for taking care of the online store’s daily operations.</p>
<p>Let’s fire up Kinsta APM to see what’s the issue.</p>
<p>After enabling Kinsta APM, I waited over 15 minutes before digging into the performance data. While waiting for that, I went about using the WooCommerce backend as usual.</p>
<figure id="attachment_84547" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84547" style="width: 1100px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-84547 size-full" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-Diagnosis.jpg" alt="WooCommerce APM - Fix performance issues with Kinsta APM" width="1100" height="659" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-Diagnosis.jpg 1100w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-Diagnosis-300x180.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-Diagnosis-1024x613.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-Diagnosis-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-84547" class="wp-caption-text">Performance metrics in Kinsta APM’s main dashboard screen</figcaption></figure>
<p>The <strong>Overall transaction time </strong>chart indicates that PHP processes take up the most time, followed by external calls.</p>
<p>Looking at the <strong>Slowest transactions</strong> table will give us a better idea of which requests are taking up most of the time.</p>
<figure id="attachment_84549" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84549" style="width: 1100px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-84549" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-Slowest-Transactions.jpg" alt="Finding the slowest transactions in Kinsta APM" width="1100" height="659" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-Slowest-Transactions.jpg 1100w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-Slowest-Transactions-300x180.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-Slowest-Transactions-1024x613.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-Slowest-Transactions-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-84549" class="wp-caption-text">Finding the slowest transactions in Kinsta APM</figcaption></figure>
<p>From the chart above, it’s clear that two transactions hog most of the time: <strong>/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php</strong> and <strong>/wp-admin</strong>.</p>			<div class="in-post-container">

<p><a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/admin-ajax-php/">High Admin-Ajax usage</a> is one of the most common performance issues faced by WordPress site owners. Let’s investigate this transaction further.</p>
<figure id="attachment_84548" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84548" style="width: 1100px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-84548" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-High-Admin-Ajax-Usage.jpg" alt="Transaction samples for admin-ajax.php requests" width="1100" height="507" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-High-Admin-Ajax-Usage.jpg 1100w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-High-Admin-Ajax-Usage-300x138.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-High-Admin-Ajax-Usage-1024x472.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-High-Admin-Ajax-Usage-768x354.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-84548" class="wp-caption-text">Transaction samples for admin-ajax.php requests</figcaption></figure>
<p>All the <strong>admin-ajax.php</strong> transaction samples have almost the same duration. A transaction duration of more than 10 seconds is abnormally high.</p>
<p>Let’s check out its slowest sample.</p>
<figure id="attachment_84545" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84545" style="width: 1100px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-84545" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-Ajax-Slowest-Transaction-Sample.jpg" alt="The slowest transaction sample for admin-ajax.php" width="1100" height="759" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-Ajax-Slowest-Transaction-Sample.jpg 1100w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-Ajax-Slowest-Transaction-Sample-300x207.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-Ajax-Slowest-Transaction-Sample-1024x707.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-Ajax-Slowest-Transaction-Sample-768x530.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-84545" class="wp-caption-text">The slowest transaction sample for the admin-ajax.php request</figcaption></figure>
<p>Scroll down through the <strong>Transaction trace timeline</strong> to find the spans of interest. In most cases, Kinsta APM will highlight them.</p>
<p>However, that’s not always the case, like in this one:</p>

<p>You can observe two spans with unusually high duration: <strong>snail_admin_refresh</strong> PHP process and <strong>suspicious-link.com GET</strong> external HTTP request.</p>
<figure id="attachment_84550" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84550" style="width: 1100px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-84550" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-Snail-Admin-Refresh-Notice.jpg" alt="Examining the slowest span’s details in Kinsta APM" width="1100" height="514" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-Snail-Admin-Refresh-Notice.jpg 1100w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-Snail-Admin-Refresh-Notice-300x140.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-Snail-Admin-Refresh-Notice-1024x478.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-Snail-Admin-Refresh-Notice-768x359.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-84550" class="wp-caption-text">Examining the slowest span’s details in Kinsta APM</figcaption></figure>
<p>Checking the span details will point you towards the plugin running this PHP process. Here, it’s a plugin called <strong>snail-admin-refresh-notice</strong>. I wrote it to output a hideous notification in the WordPress dashboard, just like <a href="https://www.matteoduo.com/upselling-advertising-crossselling-wordpress-org-dashboard/">some popular WordPress plugins</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_84551" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84551" style="width: 1100px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-84551" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-Snail-Admin-Refresh-Notice-HTTP.jpg" alt="Inspecting the stack trace on another slow span" width="1100" height="706" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-Snail-Admin-Refresh-Notice-HTTP.jpg 1100w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-Snail-Admin-Refresh-Notice-HTTP-300x193.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-Snail-Admin-Refresh-Notice-HTTP-1024x657.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Admin-Snail-Admin-Refresh-Notice-HTTP-768x493.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-84551" class="wp-caption-text">Inspecting the stack trace on another slow span</figcaption></figure>
<p>Looking at the <strong>Stack trace </strong>of the <strong>suspicious-link.com GET</strong> span, you can spot that it’s related to the same plugin.</p>
<figure id="attachment_84566" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84566" style="width: 1100px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-84566 size-full" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Snail-Admin-Refresh-Notice.jpg" alt="An annoying WordPress notice example" width="1100" height="586" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Snail-Admin-Refresh-Notice.jpg 1100w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Snail-Admin-Refresh-Notice-300x160.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Snail-Admin-Refresh-Notice-1024x546.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Snail-Admin-Refresh-Notice-768x409.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-84566" class="wp-caption-text">The annoying WordPress admin notice</figcaption></figure>
<p>Here, the cause of the slowdown is literally in the face. However, that’s not always the case. If multiple users are using the WooCommerce dashboard simultaneously, they can tax the server’s resources even more. It may even render the dashboard inaccessible for some users.</p>
<p>By helping you identify the root cause of any performance issue quickly, Kinsta APM enables you to keep your WooCommerce dashboard performing at its best, always!</p>
<h3>3. WooCommerce APM Example: Slow Shop and Product Pages</h3>
<p>Users can’t wait for slow pages to load, especially when it’s a shop or product page. According to <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-aunz/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/mobile-page-speed-load-time/">Google’s usability study</a>, users abandon a page when it takes longer than 2.5 seconds to respond.</p>
<figure id="attachment_84572" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84572" style="width: 1100px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-84572" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Test-WooCommerce-Site-Product-Page.png" alt="One of the product pages in the test WooCommerce site" width="1100" height="767" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Test-WooCommerce-Site-Product-Page.png 1100w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Test-WooCommerce-Site-Product-Page-300x209.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Test-WooCommerce-Site-Product-Page-1024x714.png 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Test-WooCommerce-Site-Product-Page-768x536.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-84572" class="wp-caption-text">One of the product pages in the test WooCommerce site</figcaption></figure>
<p>There could be many reasons a WooCommerce shop or product page is loading slowly:</p>
<ul>
<li>The shop page may have too many products loading at once.</li>
<li>The product page’s size may be large because of unoptimized images, scripts, third-party requests, etc.</li>
<li>The shop or product page may load a lot of uncacheable dynamic content on each request’s page.</li>
<li>A plugin or the theme may insert custom scripts on every product page to enable extra functionality (e.g. social share counters, related products).</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, we’ll be diagnosing slow product pages on our test WooCommerce site. They’re taking an unusually long time to respond, which usually is disastrous for conversion rates.</p>
<p>Let’s enable Kinsta APM and try loading some product pages.</p>
<p>I’ll test them for at least 5 minutes before seeing what’s up with the site’s performance metrics.</p>
<figure id="attachment_84555" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84555" style="width: 1100px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-84555" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-MySQL-Increase.jpg" alt="Notice the sharp increase in MySQL related transaction time " width="1100" height="656" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-MySQL-Increase.jpg 1100w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-MySQL-Increase-300x179.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-MySQL-Increase-1024x611.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-MySQL-Increase-768x458.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-84555" class="wp-caption-text">Notice the sharp increase in MySQL related transaction time</figcaption></figure>
<p>From the <strong>Overall transaction time</strong> chart, you can observe a drastic uptick in the time taken for MySQL queries. And going by the timestamp, it’s all recent.</p>
<p>Let’s choose a shorter duration to focus on these recent transactions. That’ll rule out all the older performance metrics from our current diagnosis.</p>
<figure id="attachment_84556" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84556" style="width: 1100px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-84556 size-full" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-MySQL-Increase-Shorter.jpg" alt="WooCommerce APM - Choosing a shorter duration in Kinsta APM" width="1100" height="656" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-MySQL-Increase-Shorter.jpg 1100w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-MySQL-Increase-Shorter-300x179.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-MySQL-Increase-Shorter-1024x611.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-MySQL-Increase-Shorter-768x458.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-84556" class="wp-caption-text">Choosing a shorter duration in Kinsta APM</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now let’s peek into the <strong>Slowest transactions</strong> table and see which requests take up the most time.</p>
<figure id="attachment_84564" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84564" style="width: 1100px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-84564" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Slowest-Transactions-Single-Product.jpg" alt="Requests for individual product pages is the slowest" width="1100" height="708" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Slowest-Transactions-Single-Product.jpg 1100w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Slowest-Transactions-Single-Product-300x193.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Slowest-Transactions-Single-Product-1024x659.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Slowest-Transactions-Single-Product-768x494.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-84564" class="wp-caption-text">Requests for individual product pages is the slowest</figcaption></figure>
<p>As expected, the <strong>/single-product</strong> transaction takes up a bulk of the total duration. WooCommerce triggers this request when a user visits any individual product page.</p>
<p>Its maximum duration (<strong>136,417.63 ms</strong>) is extraordinarily high.</p>
<p>Let’s check it out.</p>
<figure id="attachment_84559" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84559" style="width: 1100px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-84559" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-Slowest-Transactions-Samples.jpg" alt="Transaction samples for the individual product page requests" width="1100" height="521" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-Slowest-Transactions-Samples.jpg 1100w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-Slowest-Transactions-Samples-300x142.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-Slowest-Transactions-Samples-1024x485.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-Slowest-Transactions-Samples-768x364.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-84559" class="wp-caption-text">Transaction samples for the individual product page requests</figcaption></figure>
<p>I’ll click on the slowest sample to inspect it. Scrolling through its <strong>Transaction trace timeline</strong> will give us a better idea of what’s causing this performance issue.</p>
<figure id="attachment_84562" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84562" style="width: 1100px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-84562" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-Transaction-Trace-Slowest-Span.jpg" alt="The troublesome span highlighted in bold red" width="1100" height="427" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-Transaction-Trace-Slowest-Span.jpg 1100w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-Transaction-Trace-Slowest-Span-300x116.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-Transaction-Trace-Slowest-Span-1024x397.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-Transaction-Trace-Slowest-Span-768x298.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-84562" class="wp-caption-text">The troublesome span highlighted in bold red</figcaption></figure>
<p>You can see that Kinsta APM has highlighted the taxing span with a bright red color. Looking at its icon, you can infer that it’s a database query.</p>
<figure id="attachment_84560" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84560" style="width: 1100px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-84560" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-Span-Details-Stack-Trace.jpg" alt="‘Span details’ and ‘Stack trace’ of the slow database query" width="1100" height="755" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-Span-Details-Stack-Trace.jpg 1100w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-Span-Details-Stack-Trace-300x206.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-Span-Details-Stack-Trace-1024x703.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-Span-Details-Stack-Trace-768x527.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-84560" class="wp-caption-text">‘Span details’ and ‘Stack trace’ of the slow database query</figcaption></figure>
<p>Kinsta APM crunches the stack trace of this span and identifies the plugin generating this taxing database query.</p>
<p>Here, it’s a plugin named <strong>woocommerce-related-products</strong>. It’s a <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/woocommerce-extensions/">WooCommerce extension</a> that dynamically generates a slider of related products for every individual product page based on various criteria.</p>
<figure id="attachment_84557" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84557" style="width: 1051px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-84557" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-Related-Products-Dynamics.jpg" alt="The ‘related products’ slider in a product page" width="1051" height="551" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-Related-Products-Dynamics.jpg 1051w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-Related-Products-Dynamics-300x157.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-Related-Products-Dynamics-1024x537.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kinsta-APM-WooCommerce-Product-Page-Related-Products-Dynamics-768x403.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1051px) 100vw, 1051px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-84557" class="wp-caption-text">The ‘related products’ slider in a product page</figcaption></figure>
<p>Under the <strong>Span details</strong>, you can also see the database statement I injected into this WooCommerce extension to simulate this performance issue.</p>
<p>For large WooCommerce stores selling hundreds (or thousands) of products, introducing a new feature, or updating an existing one may cause unexpected performance issues. Problems like the one shown above are quite common. Kinsta APM makes it easier to diagnose and fix them.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Time and time again we see users on forums and social media complaining that managed WordPress hosting is a big waste of money. Their reason? It’s much better to manage your own server. Unfortunately, they never mention what all this actually entails. To a casual WordPress user, this can definitely give the wrong impression. It sounds easy and cheap, but the end result is you’ll probably end up spending a lot more time and money than you think.</p>

<p>You’re probably thinking, “You guys are a managed WordPress hosting company, so aren’t you a little biased?” Perhaps, but we also have the advantage of seeing the perspective of both sides. We have sysadmins on the Kinsta team that manage all of our own servers for clients, and therefore, we know what it takes to do this properly and why for most of you, <strong>being a sysadmin is actually a bad idea</strong>. In fact, in some scenarios, it can be a downright nightmare. Being a sysadmin takes a lot of patience, skill, and you have to really enjoy fixing things that break!</p>

<p>Besides our own team, we also get to see all the feedback from clients who have previously tried to manage everything themselves. Once they arrive at a managed WordPress host like Kinsta, the answer is almost always, “It’s worth every penny.”</p>
<p>If you’re contemplating between managing your own server (being a sysadmin) or going with a managed WordPress hosting provider, this article is for you! Below we’ll dive into all the advantages and disadvantages. Yes, there is good and bad on both sides.<br>

        <h2>What is a Sysadmin?</h2>
        <div><p>A systems administrator, or sysadmin, is a person responsible for configuring, updating, and keeping servers running and operational. We have sysadmins at Kinsta working 24/7 behind the scenes to ensure everything runs smoothly. When a server goes down, it’s the sysadmin’s job to troubleshoot the cause and bring it back up.</p>

<p>Anyone to an extent can be a sysadmin. It doesn’t necessarily mean they are a good one or should be doing it. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> But if a person is responsible for the management of the servers where their WordPress sites are hosted, then most likely they are doing the tasks of a sysadmin. We’ll go into all the responsibilities that typically come with this below.</p>
<h2 id="advantages-sysadmin">Advantages of Being a Sysadmin</h2>
<p>Right off the bat, you can probably tell we have a pretty strong opinion about this topic. But don’t get us wrong, being a sysadmin isn’t all bad. In fact, it definitely has some advantages over that of using a managed WordPress host.</p>
<p>However, it definitely takes a certain type of mindset and individual to be good at this. And by good, we mean, not losing money by spending more time fixing and troubleshooting, than actually working. Whether you’re a business owner, WordPress developer, or <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-agency/">agency</a>, you should ask yourself; what are the most important tasks you should be spending your time on? And do you have the skills to be a sysadmin?</p>
<h3>1. Barebone/VPS Are Really Cheap</h3>
<p>The first reason to be your own sysadmin is that the raw cost of most barebone and virtual private servers (VPS) are actually pretty cheap! If you have the chops and technical expertise, you could definitely save some money.</p>
<p>For example, if you take a look at VPS from Linode, Digital Ocean, or Vultr, these <strong>start as low as $5/month</strong>. This is even cheaper than most shared hosting providers. And some even offer pay-as-you-go plans based on resources used.</p>
<figure id="attachment_43894" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-43894" style="width: 2050px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-43894" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/digital-ocean-droplet-prices.png" alt="Digital Ocean prices" width="2050" height="1256" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/digital-ocean-droplet-prices.png 2050w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/digital-ocean-droplet-prices-300x184.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/digital-ocean-droplet-prices-1024x627.png 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/digital-ocean-droplet-prices-768x471.png 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/digital-ocean-droplet-prices-1536x941.png 1536w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/digital-ocean-droplet-prices-2048x1255.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2050px) 100vw, 2050px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-43894" class="wp-caption-text">Digital Ocean prices</figcaption></figure>
<p>The caveat here is that these machines aren’t just plug-and-play. You’re just paying for the CPU, RAM, disk, etc. While many of them have one-click apps, you are responsible for everything else. You could try to make it a little easier with a tool like ServerPilot, but this doesn’t provide you with 24/7 support when you need it the most. There is a reason this route is typically referred to as DIY hosting.</p>
<h3>2. You Can Install Whatever You Want</h3>
<p>Obviously, one of the biggest advantages of being your own sysadmin is that you have <strong>complete control over everything</strong>. You can install and run whatever you want on your server. Need a software package or PHP extension like Ioncube installed? You don’t have to worry about being slowed down by asking a support team, you can simply <a href="https://kinsta.com/help/connect-to-ssh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SSH into your server</a> and install it yourself.</p>
<h3>3. You Get Full Root Access</h3>
<p>Related to the above, some things require root access to install on servers. You typically <a href="https://kinsta.com/help/root-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">won’t get root access</a> when using a managed WordPress host. Why? Because they can’t take the risk of you breaking things. One wrong command and you could bring your server down. Root access is a “double-edged sword.” However, if you have the skills, then <strong>having full root access comes in handy</strong>. This reason alone is sometimes why users choose to manage their own servers.</p>
<h3>4. It’s Possible to Achieve Awesome Performance</h3>
<p>Another advantage is that if configured properly (and usually this takes a lot of work and knowledge), <strong>you can achieve awesome performance</strong> when managing your own servers. This is because barebone resources are typically fairly cheap and since you manage everything, you can ensure that no resources are being shared with any other sites. In fact, a lot of sites users tend to go overboard and purchase way more resources than are actually being used by their WordPress sites.</p>
<h2 id="disadvantages-sysadmin">Disadvantages of Being a Sysadmin</h2>
<p>Now it’s time to dive into the many disadvantages that come with being a sysadmin. And yes, as you probably guessed, there are a lot more disadvantages than advantages. But that’s also why a sysadmin’s job is so important. You just have to ask yourself, should that person be you?</p>

<p>We’ll also show you can accomplish each of the tasks with almost no effort at Kinsta.</p>
<h3>1. Server Set Up and Configuration is Your Entirely Your Responsibility</h3>
<p>Whenever you need a new server, setting it up is entirely your responsibility. If you’re using a barebones machine or VPS provider, this typically means spinning up a new machine. So you better know how much RAM, CPU, and PHP workers your WordPress site needs based on your traffic. You also have to know the memory requirements (<a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/convert-myisam-to-innodb/">InnoDB buffer pool</a> for the database, system memory requirements, php-fpm worker requirements, etc.).</p>
<p>After it’s running, you’ll have to configure it. Depending on what you need, this could include all sorts of tasks, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assigning an<a href="https://kinsta.com/tools/what-is-my-ip/what-is-my-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> IP address</a></li>
<li>Setting up DNS records</li>
<li>Installing Nginx/Apache (check out our web server showdown: <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/nginx-vs-apache/">Nginx vs Apache</a>)</li>
<li>Installing PHP</li>
<li>Installing software packages such as Node or Yarn</li>
<li>Installing PHP extensions such as Ioncube or Recode</li>
<li>Updating to the latest version of <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/mariadb-vs-mysql/">MySQL or MariaDB</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re using a barebone machine, installing (and upgrading) and configuring all the services required for WordPress can take days. If you use an auto-installer, you’ll still be left with no idea how to keep the machines updated or secured. Same goes for MySQL and php-fpm settings. Knowing exactly what to change and what value to change it to can make night and day difference.</p>
<p>Many don’t realize everything that goes on behind the scenes. At Kinsta, we custom compile a bunch of Linux packages for maximum performance. This is almost impossible to do on your own, and therefore you will lose performance right from the start. <strong>Our Nginx ruleset is built based on our experience running tens of thousands of high-traffic WordPress sites</strong>. These rule sets include everything from security to performance tweaks.</p>
<p>We also have over 30 different software packages and PHP extensions that are commonly used by clients. And for those of you who might not be familiar with installing server-side software, these typically aren’t just a one-click installer. To give you a better picture, below are the typical <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/ioncube-loader/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">steps needed to install Ioncube</a> (PHP extension) if you’re doing it yourself:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and extract Ioncube to the server</li>
<li>Copy the files to PHP directories</li>
<li>Edit php.ini files</li>
<li>Test and reload Nginx</li>
<li>Restart the current PHP engine</li>
<li>Check the logs, clear cache, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, if you are managing your own servers, make sure to set aside some time for configuring new ones when they are needed. And after that, you still have to install and set up your WordPress site.</p>
<h4>Launching a New Site at Kinsta</h4>
<p>If you go with a managed WordPress host like Kinsta you don’t ever have to configure anything on the server. You can launch a new WordPress site at any time. Just log in to the MyKinsta dashboard and click on “<a href="https://kinsta.com/help/new-site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Add a Site</a>.” Your biggest task will simply be trying to strategically choose from the 29 different <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/google-cloud-data-center-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data center locations</a> we offer to host your site.</p>
<figure id="attachment_43963" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-43963" style="width: 1614px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-43963" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/launch-new-wordpress-site-kinsta.png" alt="Launch new WordPress site at Kinsta" width="1614" height="964" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/launch-new-wordpress-site-kinsta.png 1614w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/launch-new-wordpress-site-kinsta-300x179.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/launch-new-wordpress-site-kinsta-1024x612.png 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/launch-new-wordpress-site-kinsta-768x459.png 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/launch-new-wordpress-site-kinsta-1536x917.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1614px) 100vw, 1614px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-43963" class="wp-caption-text">Launch new WordPress site at Kinsta</figcaption></figure>
<p>Need a new software package or PHP extension like Ioncube installed? Most likely it’s already running on Kinsta’s servers. But if not, you can easily <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/ioncube-loader/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enable it by clicking on a single button</a> on the dashboard.</p>
<h3>2. You Have to Take Care of Backups</h3>
<p>When you’re managing your own servers, you will most likely have to come up with your own backup solution. Some providers might offer an extra service for this, but it’s usually far from perfect. For example, if you are using Digital Ocean Droplets, they only offer <strong>weekly</strong> snapshots of your machine. And they also <strong>add 20% to the cost</strong> of the Droplet. Anyone would agree, weekly backups are far from enough.</p>
<p>And that is just the server backup. Most likely you would want to also configure a separate offsite backup solution for your WordPress site itself, especially if you have multiple sites on a server. Therefore, this can incur an additional cost, both for the solution and for the disk space to store them. Check out a few recommended <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-backup-plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress incremental backups plugins</a>.</p>
<h4>How Backups Work at Kinsta</h4>
<p>Backups couldn’t be easier at Kinsta! At the server-level, we create and store <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/create-snapshots" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">persistent disk snapshots</a> of every machine in our infrastructure every 4 hours for 24 hours and then every 24 hours beyond for two weeks. Google Cloud Platform automatically stores multiple copies of each snapshot redundantly across multiple locations with automatic checksums to ensure the integrity of your data.</p>
<p>This means that snapshots are stored in different datacenters from the location where they were originally created. If our Google Cloud Platform infrastructure is ever affected we will always have snapshots to restore.</p>
<p>Then when it comes to your WordPress sites, Kinsta offers <a href="https://kinsta.com/help/wordpress-backups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">automatic daily backups</a>, downloadable backups, manual backup restore points, and even system generated backups which are an automatic system backup created during certain events. And if that weren’t enough, we have an hourly backup add-on you can purchase to create backups every hour or every 6 hours. The backups are stored within the persistent disk snapshots (at multiple locations).</p>
<p>Because of this, there is no need for a backup plugin if you host with Kinsta. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f918.png" alt="🤘" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> You can restore backups with a click of a button and even copy them to your staging environment. Better yet, Kinsta doesn’t include your backups in <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/disk-usage-wordpress/">your total disk space usage</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_43980" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-43980" style="width: 1640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-43980" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wordpress-backups.png" alt="WordPress backups" width="1640" height="952" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wordpress-backups.png 1640w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wordpress-backups-300x174.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wordpress-backups-1024x594.png 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wordpress-backups-768x446.png 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/wordpress-backups-1536x892.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1640px) 100vw, 1640px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-43980" class="wp-caption-text">WordPress backups</figcaption></figure>
<h3>3. Locking Down Your Servers and WordPress Sites Is up to You</h3>
<p>When you manage your servers, locking them down is up to you. Linux hardening, in general, <strong>requires years of experience</strong>.</p>
<p>You are the one responsible if malicious code gets into your network or if someone is launching a brute-force attack. Then there are <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/what-is-a-ddos-attack/">DDoS attacks</a> that can literally take your server offline in minutes. And trust us, <strong>DDoS attacks always come at the worst time</strong>. You better know how to identify the source and block it.</p>

<p>Securing your server and WordPress sites can include a variety of different tasks, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementing <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/what-is-a-firewall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hardware and software firewalls</a> (everything from server-level software to web application <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/cloudflare-settings-wordpress/#firewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">firewalls such as Cloudflare</a> or Sucuri).</li>
<li>Install Malware scanning software. This usually entails both Linux and WordPress.</li>
<li>Patching Nginx/Apache or updating PHP with security updates.</li>
<li>Tightening file/folder restrictions on the server.</li>
<li><a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-hacked/#wordpress-site-hacked-what-to-do-stepbystep-guide">Cleaning up a hacked WordPress site</a> (you can never protect WordPress 100%, all it takes is one bad plugin).</li>
</ul>
<p>WordPress is awesome, but this year has been one of the worst we’ve ever seen in terms of plugin vulnerabilities. You better make sure you know how to properly clean up malware on a WordPress site. We hear time and time again from users trying to do this themselves and struggling with it for days!</p>
<p>Here are just a few recent incidents that our team at Kinsta has had to deal with:</p>

<p>Some VPS providers like Digital Ocean provide Cloud Firewalls. But it’s still up to you to implement them and know for example which inbound rules you need on ports, what IP addresses should backlisted or whitelisted, etc.</p>
<figure id="attachment_43948" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-43948" style="width: 868px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-43948" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/security-sysadmin.jpg" alt="Sysadmin security" width="868" height="491" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/security-sysadmin.jpg 868w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/security-sysadmin-300x170.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/security-sysadmin-768x434.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-43948" class="wp-caption-text">Sysadmin security (Image source: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/7ptgok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>)</figcaption></figure>
<h4>Rest Easy at Night with Kinsta’s Fort Knox Like Security</h4>
<p>Do you really want to spend your weekend trying to fend off a hacker or stop a DDoS attack? And do you even know how? This is why unless you have some serious technical chops when it comes to security, it’s only a matter of time into you run into a serious security problem that has you scrambling.</p>
<p>If you go with a managed WordPress host like Kinsta, we take care of all this for you. Here are just a few <a href="https://kinsta.com/secure-wordpress-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">security features</a> that we offer on all of our hosting plans.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kinsta detects DDoS attacks, <strong>monitors for uptime</strong>, and automatically bans IPs that have more than 6 failed login attempts in a minute.</li>
<li>Only encrypted SFTP and SSH connections (no FTP) are supported when accessing your WordPress sites directly (here’s the difference between <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/ftp-vs-sftp/">FTP and SFTP</a>).</li>
<li>Hardware firewalls, along with additional active and passive security measures are in place to prevent access to your data.</li>
<li>We hide both the WordPress and PHP version you’re using from front-end requests. Our open_basedir restrictions also don’t allow execution of PHP in common directories that are prone to malicious scripts.</li>
<li>Kinsta uses Linux containers (LXC) on top of <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/google-cloud-network/">Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</a> which provides <strong>complete isolation</strong> for not just each account, but each separate WordPress site. This is a much more secure method than offered by other competitors. GCP also employs data encryption at rest.

<p><figure id="attachment_73862" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-73862" style="width: 2800px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-73862" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kinsta-hosting-architecture-v8.png" alt="Kinsta hosting architecture." width="2800" height="1430" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kinsta-hosting-architecture-v8.png 2800w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kinsta-hosting-architecture-v8-300x153.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kinsta-hosting-architecture-v8-1024x523.png 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kinsta-hosting-architecture-v8-768x392.png 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kinsta-hosting-architecture-v8-1536x784.png 1536w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kinsta-hosting-architecture-v8-2048x1046.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2800px) 100vw, 2800px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-73862" class="wp-caption-text">Kinsta hosting architecture.</figcaption></figure></p></li>
<li>Kinsta utilizes Google Cloud Platform’s <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/google-cloud-network/">premium tier network</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewalls">enterprise-level firewall</a>. Our firewall configuration allows us to block malicious traffic before it enters our network of virtual machines. Compared to GCP’s standard tier network, the premium tier routes more traffic through Google’s fast and secure private network.</li>
<li>Kinsta only runs supported versions of PHP: 7.2, <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/php-7-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7.3</a>, and <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/php-7-4/">7.4</a> (excluding phase-out time). Unsupported versions of PHP are dangerous due to the fact that they no longer have security updates and are exposed to unpatched security vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing is ever 100% hack-proof, and that’s why Kinsta provides <strong>free hack fixes</strong> for all clients. That’s right! In those recent plugin vulnerabilities with Social Warfare, WP Google Map, etc. our team let clients know and cleaned up the affected sites. In some instances, our sysadmins even patch things at the server level. We take security very seriously and are proactive when it comes to your WordPress sites.</p>
<h3>4. Make Sure to Pick the Right Caching Solution</h3>
<p>When it comes to WordPress performance, nothing is more important than <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-cache/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">caching</a>!</p>
<p>Caching is the process of storing resources from one request and reusing those resources for subsequent requests. Basically, it reduces the amount of work required to generate a page view. You want to <strong>serve as much of your WordPress site from cache as possible</strong>. That is what results in those lighting fast speeds.</p>
<p>When it comes to managing your own servers, you will have a decision to make. Should you implement a server-level caching solution (such as the <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_fastcgi_module.html#fastcgi_cache" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>nginx fastcgi cache module</code></a>) or go with a <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-caching-plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress caching plugin</a> like WP Rocket? A hybrid approach is also another option.</p>
<p>Unless you’ve tested the dozens of different solutions and technologies out there, how are you supposed to know which one is best or the fastest? As a sysadmin, you should understand the difference between bytecode cache, object caching, page cache, Varnish, Redis, etc., and how they interact with both the server and plugins. Having a well fine-tuned caching solution means the difference between a slow and fast WordPress site.</p>
<h4>Kinsta Handles Caching For You (No Plugins Needed)</h4>
<p>If you host with Kinsta we handle caching for you automatically at the server-level. Our servers use the <code>nginx fastcgi cache module</code> to deliver fast page caching.</p>
<p>The page cache is configured to work right out of the box with standard WordPress, BuddyPress, <a href="https://kinsta.com/woocommerce-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WooCommerce</a>, and <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/easy-digital-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Easy Digital Download</a> sites. You don’t have to do a thing! Simply launch your WordPress site and page caching will start happening.</p>
<p>Whenever you make edits to a page or blog post, the cache of the page is automatically purged, as well as archive pages. This makes sure your visitors see fresh and up to date content. We also impose a minimal throttle time on archive pages to ensure high availability at all times.</p>
<p>And while it’s not technically a caching plugin, our must-use (MU) plugin is installed on every site which gives you more granular control over your caching. You can easily clear your site’s cache from the WordPress admin toolbar, or add custom paths to purge whenever our site is updated.</p>

<p>You can also clear your entire WordPress site’s cache from the MyKinsta dashboard with a simple click.</p>
<figure id="attachment_44101" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44101" style="width: 1515px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-44101" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/clear-wordpress-cache-mykinsta.png" alt="Clear WordPress cache in MyKinsta dashboard" width="1515" height="936" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/clear-wordpress-cache-mykinsta.png 1515w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/clear-wordpress-cache-mykinsta-300x185.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/clear-wordpress-cache-mykinsta-1024x633.png 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/clear-wordpress-cache-mykinsta-768x474.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1515px) 100vw, 1515px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-44101" class="wp-caption-text">Clear WordPress cache in MyKinsta dashboard</figcaption></figure>
<p>We also provide additionals ways you can analyze your cache data in our <a href="https://kinsta.com/help/mykinsta-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MyKinsta analytics tool</a> and the <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/wordpress-error-log/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kinsta cache logs</a>. These can help determine if there are cache BYPASSing GET requests that could be cached or POST requests that could be eliminated.</p>
<p>The cache component stack (as shown below) lets you see the status of each request, whether it was a HIT, BYPASS, MISS, or EXPIRED. You can filter the data by the past 24 hours, 7 days, or 30 days.</p>
<figure id="attachment_34342" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-34342" style="width: 1944px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-34342" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kinsta-cache-component-stack.png" alt="Kinsta cache component stack" width="1944" height="986" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kinsta-cache-component-stack.png 1944w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kinsta-cache-component-stack-300x152.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kinsta-cache-component-stack-1024x519.png 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kinsta-cache-component-stack-768x390.png 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kinsta-cache-component-stack-1536x779.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1944px) 100vw, 1944px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-34342" class="wp-caption-text">Kinsta cache component stack</figcaption></figure>
<p>The cache component chart gives you a glance at your caching ratio. The more requests you serve from cache the better. As you can see in the example below, this WordPress site is at a 96.2% cache HIT ratio. Which is good!</p>
<figure id="attachment_34343" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-34343" style="width: 1258px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-34343" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kinsta-cache-component-chart.png" alt="Kinsta cache component chart" width="1258" height="904" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kinsta-cache-component-chart.png 1258w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kinsta-cache-component-chart-300x216.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kinsta-cache-component-chart-1024x736.png 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kinsta-cache-component-chart-768x552.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1258px) 100vw, 1258px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-34343" class="wp-caption-text">Kinsta cache component chart</figcaption></figure>
<p>The top cache bypasses section lets you see which requests are not being served from cache. Typically these might include CRON jobs, admin-ajax requests, ecommerce checkout pages, query strings, and UTM parameters, etc.</p>			<div class="in-post-container">

<h3>5. Staging Environment Isn’t Magically There</h3>
<p>Staging environments provide an easy risk-free way to test updates (plugins, WordPress core, themes), <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-debug/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">debug code</a>, and do development work without impacting your production site. Many of us take staging sites for granted these days. But imagine if you didn’t have one? What would you do?</p>
<p>If you’re managing your own servers, you would need to implement your own solution. If you’re using a VPS provider like <a href="https://kinsta.com/digitalocean-alternative/">Digital Ocean</a> or <a href="https://kinsta.com/linode-alternative/">Linode</a>, you can clone your machine, but this isn’t a quick solution and isn’t free.</p>
<p>If you’re wanting a more WordPress focused solution, there are some decent ones, such as <a href="https://wpstagecoach.com">WP Stagecoach</a> (starting at $120 a year) and <a href="https://managewp.com/">ManageWP</a> (starting at $2/month per website), but again, none of these are free.</p>
<p>This is important to keep in mind if you’re comparing pricing on managing your own servers versus managed WordPress hosting.</p>
<h4>Kinsta Offers One-Click Staging</h4>
<p>At Kinsta, each WordPress site comes with its own one-click <a href="https://kinsta.com/help/staging-environment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">staging environment</a>. All you have to do is click “Create a Staging Environment” and you instantly have a copy of your production site. This makes it super easy to test things.</p>
<figure id="attachment_44107" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44107" style="width: 1565px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-44107" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/create-wordpress-staging-environment.png" alt="Create WordPress staging environment" width="1565" height="1024" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/create-wordpress-staging-environment.png 1565w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/create-wordpress-staging-environment-300x196.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/create-wordpress-staging-environment-1024x670.png 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/create-wordpress-staging-environment-768x503.png 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/create-wordpress-staging-environment-1536x1005.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1565px) 100vw, 1565px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-44107" class="wp-caption-text">Create WordPress staging environment</figcaption></figure>
<p>When you’re done, you can push the changes back to live with a push of a button. You can even restore WordPress backups of your production site to staging.</p>
<p>To give you as much space as possible, staging sites are excluded from our reporting when calculating your total disk space usage. Only live sites count against your disk space usage.</p>
<h3>6. Don’t Forget About Monitoring</h3>
<p>The last thing you want is for your website to go down on a Friday at 2 am and you don’t realize it until Monday morning. This pertains both to your server and to your WordPress sites, as each could have its own set of issues which could take them offline.</p>
<p><a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/website-downtime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Website downtime</a> can impact you a lot of different ways.</p>
<ol>
<li>Your income will take a hit.</li>
<li>It’s bad for your brand and credibility.</li>
<li>Depending on the length of downtime, your crawl rate and search rankings could suffer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, you essentially need to monitor your server and sites 24/7/365 to make sure everything is fine and running smoothly. If you’re managing your own servers, this means you’ll need uptime monitoring solutions to alert you.</p>

<p>While VPS providers like Digital Ocean and Linode offer server monitoring solutions, they don’t for your WordPress sites. Depending on the number of sites you have and types of alerts you need, you will most likely need to pay for a separate service. Below are a couple of the more popular solutions:</p>

<h4>Don’t Worry, Kinsta Has Your Back 24/7/365</h4>
<p>If you host with Kinsta, you don’t need to worry about the server-side of things. Our sysadmin team handles that! If there is an issue, you’ll get a notice in your MyKinsta dashboard or you can check our <a href="https://status.kinsta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">status page</a>.</p>
<p>In regards to your WordPress sites, we include premium uptime monitoring for all clients via New Relic. We check the status of all the websites we host every 2 minutes. That translates to <strong>720 checks for each of your WordPress sites every day</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>We take a proactive approach</strong>. This means that if your website goes down, we will be the first ones to be notified and our engineers will hop on it! If needed, we’ll reach out to you if we see something wrong with your site. This way you don’t have to worry about checking it constantly or during the holidays.</p>
<h3>7. You’ll Need SSL Certificates</h3>
<p>Your WordPress sites should be <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/http-to-https/">running over HTTPS</a>. The easiest and cheapest way to do this is with free Let’s Encrypt SSL certificates. The problem is, if you’re using a barebones machine or VPS provider you’ll need a system in place for installation and automatic renewal (Let’s Encrypt certificates expire every 90 days).</p>
<p>The most common method is probably using <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">Certbot</a>. But this entails the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Installing Certbot on your server</li>
<li>Setting up Nginx</li>
<li>Allowing HTTPS through the firewall</li>
<li>Obtaining an SSL Certificate from Let’s Encrypt</li>
<li>Verifying Certbot auto-renewal</li>
</ol>
<p>Another method would be to use a solution like ServerPilot along with your VPS provider. But this isn’t free, ServerPilot plans start at $5/month.</p>			<div class="in-post-container">

<h3>9. Are You An Expert in WordPress Performance Troubleshooting?</h3>
<p>It’s first thing Monday morning and your WordPress site has suddenly slowed to a crawl. Where do you begin to troubleshoot performance issues? Is something eating up all the resources on the server or is it something on the WordPress site itself? There are literally hundreds of things that cause performance issues with WordPress.</p>
<p>If you’re running an eCommerce or membership site, you are bound to run into performance issues at some point, as these types of sites have their own set of problems. Check out our <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/hosting-wordpress-membership-sites/">do’s and don’ts for hosting WordPress membership sites</a>.</p>
<p>The easiest way to troubleshoot a performance issue and figure out what is going on is with a premium tool like <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-performance-new-relic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Relic</a>. The catch? This tool at a <strong>bare minimum costs $75/month</strong>.</p>
<h4>Kinsta’s Platform is Scalable and We Can Help You Pinpoint Performance Issues</h4>
<p>You don’t have to worry about server resources at Kinsta. We utilize virtual machines, located in Google Cloud Platform’s multiple data centers. Each of our machines has up to 96 CPUs and hundreds of gigabytes of RAM. In available regions, we utilize their <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/boosting-wordpress-performance/#kinstas-infrastructure-and-the-new-gcp-computeoptimized-vms-c2">compute-optimized (C2) virtual machines</a>. These offer the highest performance per core that GCP offers on Compute Engine and are optimized for compute-intensive workloads. Hardware resources (RAM/CPU) are allocated to each site container automatically by our virtual machines on an as-needed basis.</p>
<p>We utilize LXD managed hosts and orchestrated LXC software containers for each site. What this means is that every WordPress site is housed in its own isolated container, which has all of the software resources required to run it (Linux, Nginx, PHP, MySQL). The <strong>resources are 100% private</strong> <strong>and are</strong> <strong>not shared</strong> between anyone else or even your own sites.</p>
<p><strong>MySQL databases are hosted at <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-localhost/">localhost</a></strong>, not a remote server. This ensures that there is no latency between machines, which results in faster queries and quicker page load times.</p>
<p>When it comes to your WordPress sites, we utilize New Relic at Kinsta to pinpoint performance bottlenecks. Need help? Just open up a ticket with our support team and we can enable New Relic for a period of time to get a better picture of what’s going on with your WordPress site.</p>
<p>It could be an external service is timing out, a plugin or the active theme is causing problems, or the site database is struggling to keep up with the rate of queries. Whatever the issue, we can usually narrow this down and provide suggestions on how to fix the problem.</p>
<figure id="attachment_20852" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-20852" style="width: 1770px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-20852" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/fix-wordpress-performance-issue.png" alt="Fixed WordPress performance issue" width="1770" height="736" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/fix-wordpress-performance-issue.png 1770w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/fix-wordpress-performance-issue-300x125.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/fix-wordpress-performance-issue-768x319.png 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/fix-wordpress-performance-issue-1024x426.png 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/fix-wordpress-performance-issue-610x254.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1770px) 100vw, 1770px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-20852" class="wp-caption-text">Fixed WordPress performance issue</figcaption></figure>
<p>Troubleshooting performance issues or problems with a plugin/theme is something our team does on a daily basis. You are in good hands at Kinsta. Our entire support team is made up of WordPress developers and Linux hosting engineers. Rest assured, you’ll be talking to someone who can provide actionable advice.</p>
<p>If you want to dive into New Relic yourself, we also have support for your own custom <a href="https://kinsta.com/help/custom-new-relic-tracking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Relic tracking</a>.</p>
<h3>10. Updating Software Can Be Time Consuming</h3>
<p>What would you rather spend your time doing, growing your business or updating software? When you manage your own servers, you will have to update software all the time, check for security patches, and install things like the latest PHP versions.</p>
<p>For the most part, this has to be done via SSH from the command line. So be prepared to whip out your <code>sudo apt-get update</code> commands.</p>
<h4>Kinsta Always Offers the Latest and Greatest</h4>
<p>You don’t have to install anything when you host at Kinsta. We employ only the best technology at Kinsta, from our server hardware to the software we run. No matter what development stack you use, we’ll always have the latest framework versions installed and up to date.</p>
<p>We typically release the latest version of PHP within weeks of its official release! That’s right, unlike our competitors, you won’t be waiting for months or even years. We even try to release beta versions if you want to test sooner.</p>
<p>Why is this so important? Because in our recent <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/php-benchmarks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PHP benchmarks</a>, if you compare PHP 7.3 to PHP 5.6, it can handle 3x as many requests (transactions) per second! <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/php-7-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PHP 7.3</a> is also on average 9% faster than PHP 7.2. Not only can the latest versions of PHP help speed up your site, they also impact your WordPress admin dashboard responsiveness.</p>
<figure id="attachment_37393" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-37393" style="width: 940px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-37393" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wordpress-5.0-php-benchmarks-v2.png" alt="WordPress 5.0 PHP benchmarks" width="940" height="788" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wordpress-5.0-php-benchmarks-v2.png 940w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wordpress-5.0-php-benchmarks-v2-300x251.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/wordpress-5.0-php-benchmarks-v2-768x644.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-37393" class="wp-caption-text">WordPress 5.0 PHP benchmarks</figcaption></figure>
<p>Faster speeds plus improved security, is why Kinsta always offers the most recent versions of PHP. You can <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/how-to-update-php-in-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">change PHP versions</a> with a single click.</p>
<figure id="attachment_63243" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-63243" style="width: 1565px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-63243" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/change-to-php-7.4.png" alt="Change to PHP 7.4" width="1565" height="990" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/change-to-php-7.4.png 1565w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/change-to-php-7.4-300x190.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/change-to-php-7.4-1024x648.png 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/change-to-php-7.4-768x486.png 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/change-to-php-7.4-1536x972.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1565px) 100vw, 1565px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-63243" class="wp-caption-text">Change to PHP 7.4</figcaption></figure>
<h3>11. You Have to Spend Time Looking for Answers</h3>
<p>It doesn’t matter how good you are at managing servers, it’s inevitable that at some point you’ll run into a problem where you have to spend time looking for answers. Whether it’s browsing StackOverflow or asking a fellow colleague, this probably isn’t a good use of your time.</p>
<p>We consistently get clients that <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-migration-plugins/">migrate their WordPress site</a> to Kinsta because they were having a hard time trying to debug downtime with their VPS.</p>
<figure id="attachment_43946" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-43946" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-43946 size-full" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/sysadmin-keep-server-running-2-1-1.jpg" alt="sysadmin comic" width="800" height="832"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-43946" class="wp-caption-text">Sysadmin comic (Image source: <a href="https://theunderfold.com/2017/06/19/server-maintenance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Underfold</a>, by Brian Russell)</figcaption></figure>
<h4>Save Your Time, Use Kinsta’s 24/7 World-Class Support</h4>

<p><strong>We literally changed how support works!</strong> We don’t have level 1 or level 2 support reps. Our entire support team is made up of WordPress developers and Linux hosting engineers many of whom have managed their own servers, created themes and plugins, and contributed back to core. This ensures you’ll receive expert advice from someone who actively uses and develops with WordPress.</p>

<h3>12. You Have to Be Prepared for Viral Traffic</h3>
<p>Did you just hit the front page of Hacker News or Reddit? While that’s awesome, it also means your server better be up to the task. Your $10 droplet probably won’t cut it. If you have any uncacheable content you’re serving up, forget about it!</p>

<p>If you know about an event in advance, you can take this one step further and <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/dedicated-server/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">capitalize on exponential traffic spikes and surges</a>. During this process, our team will take a look at your WordPress site and the analytics data available on our platform and point out areas for improvement – such as reducing calls to admin-ajax.php, disabling time-consuming plugins, implementing a CDN, and making changes to increase the site’s use of page caching.</p>
<h2 id="time-worth">How Much Is Your Time Worth? Are You Really Saving Money?</h2>
<p>If you’re thinking about being a sysadmin or managing your own servers, you should first ask yourself, how much is your time worth? And by doing it yourself, are you actually saving money? Let’s crunch a few numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>For a decent VPS, you’re looking at a minimum of $15/month.</li>
<li>Add another $5/month for a backup solution/offsite storage.</li>
<li>Add another $5/month for a <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-cdn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CDN</a>. Kinsta includes free CDN bandwidth on all plans.</li>
<li>Add another $2/month for a staging site.</li>
<li>Add another $5/month for a decent uptime monitoring solution (server + WordPress sites) with multiple alert methods.</li>
<li>Add $75/month for a New Relic APM license for performance troubleshooting.</li>
<li>Let’s say you value your time at $30/hour and you spend a bare minimum of 5 hours a month running server updates, cleaning up malware, troubleshooting, etc. That comes out to $150.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your total comes to<strong> $257/month</strong>.</p>
<p>At Kinsta, <strong>our hosting plans start at $30/month</strong> and we do all the heavy lifting for you.</p>
<div class="col-xs-12 mb--40">
<div class="text-quote__text text--large mb--20">I was skeptical about using a managed WordPress provider when we had previously always managed our own hosting, but <strong>Kinsta is worth it</strong>. Their platform works perfectly without any tweaking. If you have problematic high traffic sites like us, you’ll love their migration service — they took care of everything and even identified some problem plugins that had been installed by former members of our team. I would have spent hours on the migration due to the size without their help. To top it off, their support team is very responsive — answering within minutes. Thanks, Kinsta!</div>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>We have nothing but the utmost respect for sysadmins! Kinsta’s sysadmin team keeps our client’s WordPress sites online. As <a href="https://opensource.com/tags/sysadmin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Opensource.com</a> puts it, “Sysadmins are the <strong>unsung heroes of the technology world</strong>.”</p>
<p>If you’re a tech-savvy individual and enjoying working with servers, by all means, being a sysadmin and doing everything yourself might be the way to go. But it’s important to crunch all the numbers, and this must include your time.</p>
<p>Managed WordPress hosting in many scenarios can actually save you a lot of money. You no longer have to worry about any technical issues. You can focus instead on other things, such as running your business, content creation, marketing, sales, etc.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>For your business to succeed online today you have to juggle all sorts of things; everything from marketing, hosting, social media, advertising, content creation, etc. This can all become quickly overwhelming and very stressful. Today we want to explore why choosing a <strong>managed WordPress hosting service</strong>, as opposed to a shared host or small VPS, can be one of the most important decisions you can make as it pertains to your website.</p>

<p>Your business deserves the best and <strong>a managed WordPress host gives you that competitive edge</strong>. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f4aa.png" alt="💪" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h2>What is Managed WordPress Hosting?</h2>
<p>So first off, what exactly do we mean when we say managed WordPress hosting and how is it different than shared or <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/sysadmin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">do it yourself (DIY) hosting</a>? To best explain this let’s first break down the general online population into the three <a href="https://kinsta.com/wordpress-hosting/">WordPress hosting</a> scenarios we typically see:</p>
<p><a href="https://kinsta.com/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=migrate_free_banner&utm_campaign=wp_hosting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-86515 size-full" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/migrate-kinsta-managed-wordpress-hosting.jpg" alt="Managed WordPress Hosting with free migrations.

<h3 id="shared-hosting">1. Shared WordPress Hosting</h3>
<p>The first crowd is typically people just starting out who choose to go with low-cost shared WordPress hosting. These include hosts like <a href="https://kinsta.com/godaddy-alternative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoDaddy</a>, <a href="https://kinsta.com/bluehost-alternative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluehost</a>, <a href="https://kinsta.com/hostgator-alternative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hostgator</a>, <a href="https://kinsta.com/siteground-alternative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SiteGround</a>, <a href="https://kinsta.com/media-temple-alternative/">Media Temple</a>, <a href="https://kinsta.com/ovh-alternative/">OVH</a>, <a href="https://kinsta.com/greengeeks-hosting-alternative/">GreenGeeks</a>, etc. Usually, these are people who are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building their first website.</li>
<li><a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-com-to-wordpress-org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Migrating away from WordPress.com</a>.</li>
<li>On a strict budget and need to keep things as cheap as possible.</li>
<li>Someone that doesn’t understand the differences between the different types of hosting, and therefore is simply making a decision based on price (hint: this is not good!).</li>
</ul>

<p>Shared WordPress hosting plans usually range anywhere from $3 to $25 a month. There is nothing wrong with starting like this, but there are a few things people should be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>No matter how you do the math, after expenses, $3 a month isn’t actually generating any revenue for the hosting company. Especially when you attribute support into that. One support ticket and they’re already in the red. The way a shared host makes a lot of their money is on <strong>upselling and hidden fees</strong>. These upsells include things like <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-migration-plugins/">migrations</a>, domain registrations, renewal fees, SSL certificates (even for <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/woocommerce-ssl/">WooCommerce sites</a>), etc.</li>
<li>To make money most hosts offer what they call their “unlimited resources” plan. You have probably all seen this. Well, <strong>there is no such thing in the real world as unlimited resources</strong>. What hosts will do is throttle the clients using up a lot of the resources. This, in turn, ends up with those angry clients leaving, making room for more clients that don’t use a lot of resources.  In the end, you have a vicious cycle of the hosting company pushing cheap plans, signing up customers who they hope won’t use a lot of resources and will purchase upsells. <strong>It’s all about volume</strong>.</li>
<li>Also, because the plan is so cheap this usually forces the host to <strong>overcrowd their servers to consolidate resources</strong>. So even though you don’t know it, your website might be on the same server as 500+ other people. Any performance issues that pop up with other sites can, in turn, affect your site.</li>
</ul>

<p>You combine everything mentioned above together and what do you get? You get slow performance and bad support. Shared hosts have to spread their teams way too thin, which results in long ticket times and subpar customer service.</p>

<h3>2. DIY VPS WordPress Hosting</h3>
<p>The second crowd of people is typically bootstrap startups and people with a little more development or WordPress experience. They are the DIY crowd. These folks are typically still trying to save money, but they are also usually concerned with performance and realize its importance in the success of their business. Common setups might include using Digital Ocean, <a href="https://kinsta.com/linode-alternative/">Linode</a>, or Vultr VPS, along with a tool like ServerPilot to manage it more easily.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7572" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wordpress-vps.jpg" alt="wordpress vps" width="800" height="86" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wordpress-vps.jpg 800w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wordpress-vps-300x32.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wordpress-vps-768x83.jpg 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wordpress-vps-460x49.jpg 460w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>

A small VPS from <a href="https://kinsta.com/digitalocean-alternative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DigitalOcean</a> starts at $5 a month and the popular plan at ServerPilot starts at $10 a month. So depending on your setup you could be looking at a cost of between $5 to $15 or more a month. The DIY approach can definitely cut costs, but it also means that you are responsible if something breaks, and for optimizing your server for performance.</p>
<p>The DIY approach can be great, but it can also backfire on you if you aren’t careful. Don’t go this route just because you want to tinker! <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/sysadmin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Your time is worth money</strong> and you should be spending it on growing your business</a>. Take advantage of more than a decade of experience the Kinsta team has fixing WordPress issues on a daily basis.</p>
<h3>3. Managed WordPress Hosting</h3>
<p>The third crowd of people are typically small to medium-sized businesses, high traffic blogs, and companies looking for specialized <a href="https://kinsta.com/enterprise-wordpress-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enterprise WordPress hosting</a>. This crowd realizes that <strong>a managed WordPress hosting is a good investment</strong> because it saves them manpower, time, and usually offers better performance since it’s fine-tuned for the CMS.</p>
<p>Plans for managed WordPress hosting typically range anywhere from $25 to $150 a month or more depending on the size of your site and needs. Some popular managed WordPress hosts you are probably familiar with, or maybe also are currently using include <a href="https://kinsta.com/plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinsta</a>, <a href="https://kinsta.com/wp-engine-alternative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WP Engine</a>, <a href="https://kinsta.com/flywheel-hosting-alternative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flywheel</a>, <a href="https://kinsta.com/pressable-alternative/">Pressable</a>, <a href="https://kinsta.com/media-temple-alternative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Media Temple</a>, Pressidium, and <a href="https://kinsta.com/pagely-alternative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pagely</a>.</p>
<p>Large companies like jQuery, Plesk, Dyn, and NGINX are all using WordPress to host their website.

<h2>Why You Should Choose Managed WordPress Hosting</h2>
<p>Now just because we separated people into three different groups above doesn’t mean it is necessarily always the right way to go. You should do your research to make the right choice for your business. Perhaps you start with the DIY method and upgrade to managed hosting after you grow.</p>
<p>Or you could invest in managed hosting, to begin with, and focus all of your efforts on growing your business. There is no right or wrong path, but let us share with you 9 reasons why managed WordPress hosting can benefit you today.</p>

<h2><a id="wordpress-support"></a>1. You Get Superior Support</h2>
<p>The number one reason you should choose managed WordPress hosting is <strong>superior support</strong>. Typically managed WordPress hosting providers only deal with the WordPress platform. This means they don’t mess with Drupal, Magento, or any other type of platform or software. Typically support teams that focus on one area will become experts in that area, even if they aren’t to begin with!</p>
<p>The support team here at Kinsta are all WordPress developers and Linux Engineers, contribute to WordPress Core and other open source projects, and use WordPress on a daily basis. As a result, the expertise of our support department is second to none. Nothing is worse than launching a chat session and feeling like you know more than the person on the other end. This will never happen at Kinsta!</p>
<p>When Kinsta first began, we knew the industry was broken in terms of how <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-support/">WordPress support is handled</a>. This is why our team is structured completely different. We don’t have separate levels or tiers. The support team member that helps you is fully qualified to fix every type of problem, all the way to resolution. There is no bouncing around between different reps, as we think this is a huge waste of time. Everyone gets to chat to the same support team members that back our Fortune 500 and enterprise clients! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f44f.png" alt="👏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<div class="col-xs-12 mb--30">
<div class="text-quote__text text--large mb--20">
<p>I’ve tried many different hosts – <a href="https://kinsta.com/liquid-web-alternative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LiquidWeb</a>, SoftLayer, <a href="https://kinsta.com/wp-engine-alternative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WP Engine</a>, Web Synthesis, <a href="https://kinsta.com/rackspace-alternative/">Rackspace</a>, etc. Out of all of them, Kinsta has been the best in terms of support, speed, and pricing. I’m very impressed with the knowledge and skill of the support team, as well as response times and not having to deal with your typical ‘level 1’ support. Expert support fast, what more can you ask for? WordPress site runs really fast with Kinsta and it was very hard to find the necessary expertise with these other companies. Additionally, I love the fact that I can up-scale a server for a week during peak traffic times to handle the load. Amazing.</p>

<p>WPMU DEV reviewed Kinsta without us knowing, which makes for a great unbiased opinion. Here is what Raelene thought of our support team.</p>
<div class="col-xs-12 mb--30">
<div class="text-quote__text text--large mb--20">
<p>My experiences contacting the support team were excellent. I received detailed and honest answers to all of my questions. When I enquired about their hardware I didn’t expect an answer like this:</p>
<p>“We use Google Compute Engine servers, which ensure high speed and automatic scalability which means that instead of being constrained to 2-6 CPUs per VPS as with other providers we actually let the site’s container to scale to as many CPUs as needed when there’s a surge, and for load-balanced clients an infinite number of CPUs as our system dynamically spins up more machines and scales back when the traffic wave subsides.”</p>
<p><strong>I tried to quiz them with some common WordPress related site issues and got all the right answers, so top marks!</strong></p>
<p>Kinsta uses a ticket-based support system via Intercom. It feels like a real-time chat but in the background, it isn’t. I got a response within 5 minutes when I tried to talk to them a 3 pm. I also tried at 5 am (I happened to be up early while writing) and got an answer within 3 minutes. I may have just picked two low-support times by chance but impressive nonetheless!</p>

<p>Like Raelene said, we have used <a href="https://www.intercom.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intercom</a> since day one here at Kinsta and it has worked very well for us. Nobody likes the old-fashioned ticket systems and many companies are now migrating to more innovative solutions such as Intercom. It has provided an easy way for us to integrate chat and support tickets into our dashboard so customers know we are always one click away, <strong>24/7 365 days a year</strong> (as seen below). Our average response time in Q3 2019 was <strong>1 minute and 19 seconds</strong>!

<p>So when it comes to choosing a host with a reliable and knowledgeable support team, managed WordPress hosts typically will be a level above the rest, simply because they live and breathe WordPress on a daily basis. Kinsta also includes premium uptime monitoring for all clients via Sentry. We check the status of all the websites we host every 2 minutes. That translates to 720 checks for each of your sites every day.</p>
<p>This means that if your website goes down, we will be the first ones to be notified and our support team will hop on it! To help you diagnose performance-related issues, we also have support for your own custom <a href="https://kinsta.com/help/custom-new-relic-tracking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Relic tracking</a>.</p>
<h2><a id="wordpress-performance"></a>2. Optimized for High-Performance</h2>
<p>The second reason to choose a managed WordPress hosting provider is that their environments are typically <strong>fine-tuned to work with WordPress</strong>.</p>
<p>If you go with a shared host or the DIY route they will typically be on more barebone machines and you will need to spend time installing software and optimizing to obtain the same speeds that a managed WordPress host offers out the box. Or in some cases, on a shared host, there won’t be anything you can do to achieve the speeds you need.</p>
<p>We took a poll on Twitter, and with over a hundred votes, <strong>63% of people chose “performance/uptime”</strong> as the quality they value most in a managed WordPress host.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">When it comes to managed <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WordPress</a> hosting, what do you value the most? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f4cb.png" alt="📋" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Whether you're a business owner, developer, agency or blogger, we'd love to hear from you!</p>
<p>— Kinsta (@kinsta) <a href="https://twitter.com/kinsta/status/1094796800630829056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>For example, lots of managed WordPress hosts including us here at Kinsta implement <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-cache/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">server-level caching</a> and or full page caching. What that means is that caching is handled by us. There’s no need to hassle with figuring out what the <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-caching-plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fastest caching plugin</a> is because you won’t need one. This alone can save you a lot of frustration as caching plugins are never fun to deal with. And in most scenarios, server-level caching is much faster than any plugin.</p>
<p>It’s crucial you deliver as many assets as possible from cache during surges of traffic. This reduces the load on the server and ensures things are delivered lightning fast. At Kinsta you can use our <a href="https://kinsta.com/help/mykinsta-analytics/#cache-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cache Analysis report</a> to make sure the bulk of your WordPress site is serving from cache.</p>
<figure id="attachment_34221" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-34221" style="width: 2336px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-34221" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/managed-wordpress-hosting-performance-cache.png" alt="managed WordPress hosting cache" width="2336" height="892" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/managed-wordpress-hosting-performance-cache.png 2336w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/managed-wordpress-hosting-performance-cache-300x115.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/managed-wordpress-hosting-performance-cache-1024x391.png 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/managed-wordpress-hosting-performance-cache-768x293.png 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/managed-wordpress-hosting-performance-cache-1536x587.png 1536w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/managed-wordpress-hosting-performance-cache-2048x782.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2336px) 100vw, 2336px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-34221" class="wp-caption-text">managed WordPress hosting cache</figcaption></figure>
<p>A high-performance managed WordPress host should also provide you with the latest and greatest architecture and technology. This includes utilizing the latest versions of PHP 7, <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/mariadb-vs-mysql/">MariaDB</a>, HTTP/2 and <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-nginx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NGINX</a>, which have all been proven to be one of the fastest combinations for WordPress.</p>
<p>If your WordPress host is taking ages to release the latest versions of PHP,<strong> they are holding you back! </strong>That doesn’t fly with us. In fact, Kinsta released PHP 7.2 and 7.3 within weeks of their final and tested release. This allows clients to start testing earlier and take advantage of free and instant performance gains.</p>
<p>How important is the version of PHP you’re running? From our <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/php-benchmarks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PHP benchmark report</a>, PHP 7.3 is on average 9% faster than PHP 7.2. Who doesn’t want a free 9% speed boost? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>And to take it one step further, we here at Kinsta were the first managed WordPress hosting provider to exclusively use <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/google-cloud-network/">Google Cloud Platform and its premium tier network</a>. Kinsta was just recently named top tier once again in Review Signal’s annual 2018 <a href="https://reviewsignal.com/blog/wordpress-hosting-performance-benchmarks-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress hosting performance benchmarks</a>. And we are in fact <a href="https://cloud.google.com/wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recommended by Google</a>.</p>
<p>Here is an example below of load times significantly decreasing on a client’s site after we moved them to Google Cloud Platform. Before the move, they were getting spikes within the 3-4 second range, and after they stayed consistently under 1 second, and under 400 ms in the United States. Just by migrating them to <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/google-cloud-hosting/">Google Cloud Platform</a>, they saw a <strong>75% decrease in load times!</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_36666" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-36666" style="width: 1549px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-36666" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/google-cloud-platform-load-time-1.png" alt="Google Cloud Platform load time" width="1549" height="886" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/google-cloud-platform-load-time-1.png 1549w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/google-cloud-platform-load-time-1-300x172.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/google-cloud-platform-load-time-1-1024x586.png 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/google-cloud-platform-load-time-1-768x439.png 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/google-cloud-platform-load-time-1-1536x879.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1549px) 100vw, 1549px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-36666" class="wp-caption-text">Google Cloud Platform load time</figcaption></figure>
<p>And here is an example of what happened when someone migrated away from Kinsta to shared hosting. Their load time went from 300 ms to 14 seconds! The shared host was just not able to handle the large traffic site.</p>
<figure id="attachment_8289" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8289" style="width: 959px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-8289" title="Shared hosting vs managed WordPress hosting" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/shared-hosting-slow.png" alt="Shared hosting vs managed WordPress hosting" width="959" height="538" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/shared-hosting-slow.png 699w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/shared-hosting-slow-300x168.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/shared-hosting-slow-460x258.png 460w" sizes="(max-width: 959px) 100vw, 959px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8289" class="wp-caption-text">Shared hosting vs managed WordPress hosting</figcaption></figure>
<p>Here is another example of our test site running on Kinsta. As you can see it loads in under 400 ms with a performance grade of 100. That is fast!</p>
<figure id="attachment_7577" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7577" style="width: 1925px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-7577 size-full" title="WordPress speed test at Kinsta" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wordpress-speed-test.jpg" alt="WordPress speed test at Kinsta" width="1925" height="500" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wordpress-speed-test.jpg 1925w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wordpress-speed-test-300x78.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wordpress-speed-test-768x199.jpg 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wordpress-speed-test-1024x266.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wordpress-speed-test-460x119.jpg 460w" sizes="(max-width: 1925px) 100vw, 1925px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-7577" class="wp-caption-text">WordPress speed test at Kinsta</figcaption></figure>
<p>If we take a look at the HTTP header we can see it is being served up from Kinsta cache on a server-level and there is no caching plugin running.</p>
<figure id="attachment_7578" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7578" style="width: 1561px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-7578 size-full" title="Kinsta HTTP cache header" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kinsta-cache-http-header.png" alt="Kinsta HTTP cache header" width="1561" height="468" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kinsta-cache-http-header.png 1561w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kinsta-cache-http-header-300x90.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kinsta-cache-http-header-768x230.png 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kinsta-cache-http-header-1024x307.png 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kinsta-cache-http-header-460x138.png 460w" sizes="(max-width: 1561px) 100vw, 1561px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-7578" class="wp-caption-text">Kinsta HTTP cache header</figcaption></figure>

<p>Kinsta utilizes LXD managed hosts and orchestrated LXC software containers for each site. What this means is that <strong>every WordPress site is housed in its own isolated container</strong>, which has all of the software resources required to run it (Linux, Nginx, PHP, MySQL). The resources are 100% private and are not shared with anyone else or even your own sites.</p>
<figure id="attachment_73862" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-73862" style="width: 2800px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-73862" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kinsta-hosting-architecture-v8.png" alt="Kinsta hosting architecture." width="2800" height="1430" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kinsta-hosting-architecture-v8.png 2800w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kinsta-hosting-architecture-v8-300x153.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kinsta-hosting-architecture-v8-1024x523.png 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kinsta-hosting-architecture-v8-768x392.png 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kinsta-hosting-architecture-v8-1536x784.png 1536w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kinsta-hosting-architecture-v8-2048x1046.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2800px) 100vw, 2800px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-73862" class="wp-caption-text">Kinsta hosting architecture.</figcaption></figure>
<p>We then use virtual machines located in one of Google Cloud Platform’s multiple data centers around the world. Our VMs are configured to route traffic over Google Cloud’s premium tier network. Compared to Google Cloud’s standard tier network, the premium tier routes the majority of traffic through Google’s private network of data centers instead of the public Internet. This results in lower network latency and faster page load times for your WordPress site. According to a study performed by Cedexis, Google’s premium tier network is <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/google-cloud-hosting/#2-private-global-fiber--tiered-network">nearly 30% faster</a> than the standard tier network.</p>
<p>Each one of our GCP virtual machines has up to 96 CPUs and hundreds of gigabytes of RAM. In available regions, we utilize <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/boosting-wordpress-performance/#kinstas-infrastructure-and-the-new-gcp-computeoptimized-vms-c2">compute-optimized (C2) virtual machines</a>. These offer the highest performance per core that GCP offers on Compute Engine and are optimized for compute-intensive workloads. Hardware resources (RAM/CPU) are allocated to each site container automatically by our virtual machines on an as-needed basis.</p>

<h2><a id="global-reach"></a>3. Strategically Located Data Centers for Global Reach</h2>
<p>Besides just server-level performance, managed WordPress hosting providers also typically have a larger infrastructure that is designed for global reach. Thanks to Google Cloud Platform, we have <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/google-cloud-data-center-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">29 different regions</a> here at Kinsta from which you can choose to host your WordPress site. This includes locations across the USA, Canada, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and South America. Strategically placing your site closer to your visitors and customers decreases <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/network-latency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">network latency</a>, <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/ttfb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TTFB</a>, and ensures for faster page load times.</p>
<figure id="attachment_44221" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44221" style="width: 1613px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-44221 size-full" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/google-cloud-data-center-locations-20-3.png" alt="Google Cloud data center locations" width="1613" height="843"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-44221" class="wp-caption-text">Google Cloud data center locations</figcaption></figure>
<p>Latency refers to the time and or delay that is involved in the transmission of data over a network. The further the distance the greater the latency. For example, if you run a local WooCommerce shop in Sydney, Australia, you should be hosting your site in Australia. If you were to host your site in the USA, customers would see a much longer first-time page load. The initial DOC load comes from your host server, so having the ability to <strong>place your site where your customers are</strong> is very important!</p>
<p>Utilizing a content delivery network (<a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-cdn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CDN</a>) can then help with speeding up the rest of your site’s media. Kinsta includes a free HTTP/2 CDN with 200+ global pops to turbocharge your assets. Another great free alternative that many utilize is <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/install-cloudflare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudflare</a>.</p>
<p>Everything at Kinsta is also interconnected over the highly reliable Google Cloud Platform’s “<a href="https://cloud.google.com/network-tiers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">premium tier</a>” network. This is designed to minimize distance and hops, resulting in faster more secure global transport of your data. Some hosting providers might opt for Google’s “standard tier” network service to cut costs, but we believe in only utilizing the best here at Kinsta.</p>
<p>How much of an impact does this have? Well, for data traveling across continents, the premium tier network is about <strong>41% faster</strong>, on average, than the standard tier network. For data traveling to a nearby region (same continent), the premium tier is about <strong>8% faster</strong>. While networking only makes up a fraction of your total page load times, every millisecond adds up!</p>
<h2><a id="wordpress-backups"></a>4. Automatic Backups (Never Lose Your Data)</h2>
<p>What would you do if you suddenly lost everything? You should always be prepared for the worst-case scenario, and this includes always having backups of your WordPress site. A quality managed WordPress hosting provider should always include automatic backups for no additional charge. With shared hosts typically backups are included, but in the higher-cost plans. And if you go the DIY route with a VPS, usually you have to set up your own backup system as well as VPS snapshots which also cost extra.</p>
<figure id="attachment_39463" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-39463" style="width: 1460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-39463" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wordpress-backups-4.png" alt="WordPress backups" width="1460" height="730" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wordpress-backups-4.png 1460w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wordpress-backups-4-300x150.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wordpress-backups-4-1024x512.png 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wordpress-backups-4-768x384.png 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wordpress-backups-4-360x180.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 1460px) 100vw, 1460px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-39463" class="wp-caption-text">WordPress backups</figcaption></figure>
<p>We include <a href="https://kinsta.com/help/wordpress-backups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">automatic backups</a> of all WordPress sites for free, no additional setup is required. 14 backups are accessible at any given time from right within the MyKinsta dashboard for an easy one-click restore. You can also always take manual backups with a click of a button. This is very handy if perhaps you are installing something new and want to ensure you don’t break anything.</p>
<figure id="attachment_23841" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-23841" style="width: 1897px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-23841 size-full" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/create-wordpress-backup-2.png" alt="Creating a WordPress backup with Kinsta's Managed WordPress Hosting" width="1897" height="1118" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/create-wordpress-backup-2.png 1897w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/create-wordpress-backup-2-300x177.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/create-wordpress-backup-2-1024x603.png 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/create-wordpress-backup-2-768x453.png 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/create-wordpress-backup-2-1536x905.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1897px) 100vw, 1897px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-23841" class="wp-caption-text">Create WordPress backup</figcaption></figure>
<p>Not only do we have automatic backups, but you can also download a full backup (files and .sql file) of your WordPress site at any time. And if you have a WooCommerce store or site with a lot of dynamic content, we have add-ons in which you can automatically back up your site every hour or every six hours.</p>			<div class="in-post-container">

<p>Having multiple options for your <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/backup-wordpress-site/">WordPress backups</a> can save you a lot of time as you don’t have to mess with backup plugins, cPanel, FTP, or phpMyAdmin.</p>
<h2><a id="wordpress-staging"></a>5. One-Click Staging Environments</h2>
<p>Testing, testing, testing. You can’t afford your website to go down so you should always be testing new changes, plugins, PHP versions, and updates on a development site, not your production site! With most web hosting providers however testing involves a complex and time-consuming process of copying your site locally, testing, and then figuring out how to migrate the changes back. A lot of managed WordPress hosting providers include <a href="https://kinsta.com/wordpress-staging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one-click WordPress staging environments</a> specifically to make testing a breeze.</p>
<figure id="attachment_39462" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-39462" style="width: 1568px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-39462 size-full" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wordpress-staging-environment-2.png" alt="WordPress staging environment in Kinsta's Managed WordPress Hosting platform" width="1568" height="883" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wordpress-staging-environment-2.png 1568w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wordpress-staging-environment-2-300x169.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wordpress-staging-environment-2-1024x577.png 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wordpress-staging-environment-2-768x432.png 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wordpress-staging-environment-2-1536x865.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1568px) 100vw, 1568px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-39462" class="wp-caption-text">WordPress staging environment</figcaption></figure>
<p>One-click staging or dev environments are designed to let you clone your website with a single press of a button. Your dev site is then accessible via a test URL and you can also access via all the typical methods such as FTP, SSH, phpMyAdmin, etc. You can then easily <a href="https://kinsta.com/help/push-staging-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">push your changes to production</a> from within the dashboard.</p>
<h2><a id="wordpress-dev"></a>6. Developer-Friendly (SSH, Git, WP-CLI)</h2>
<p>Another advantage that managed WordPress hosting providers is that you usually have access to additional developer-friendly features that you might not get with a shared host. This includes features such as SSH access, Composer, HeidiSQL, Sequel Pro, and Git. Normally shared hosts won’t give you SSH access, meaning you can’t use any of the above features. If you are using a DIY VPS, these can be usually set up, but it might require some additional work.</p>
<p>Here at Kinsta, you can easily access your SSH connection information via your MyKinsta dashboard, along with these additional developer features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to run different versions of PHP between sites and staging sites. You can also one-click change the engine at will.</li>
<li>Support for custom setups such as Bedrock and <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/reverse-proxy/">reverse proxy</a> configurations.</li>
<li>Faster performance with our <a href="https://kinsta.com/help/redis-cache/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redis</a> add-on.</li>
</ul>
<div class="mceTemp"></div>
<p><a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wp-cli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WP-CLI</a> is another tool that is becoming very popular in the WordPress community. WP-CLI is a command line tool for managing many-many aspects of a WordPress installation. It can add/remove users, posts, categories, insert test data, search and replace in the database, and much more. For a lot of developers, WP-CLI is a dream come true! And Kinsta’s architecture supports WP-CLI out of the box.</p>
<h2><a id="wordpress-security"></a>7. Security Is Taken Seriously</h2>
<p>And you can’t forget security! Typically in shared hosting environments, they don’t provide any assistance if you’re hacked or if you encounter malware. This goes for the DIY VPS route as well. If <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-hacked/">your WordPress site is hacked</a>, you’re responsible. A lot of managed WordPress hosting providers include support if your site is hacked and they have systems in place to protect you from malware.</p>
<figure id="attachment_39464" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-39464" style="width: 1460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-39464" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wordpress-security-2.png" alt="WordPress security" width="1460" height="730" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wordpress-security-2.png 1460w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wordpress-security-2-300x150.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wordpress-security-2-1024x512.png 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wordpress-security-2-768x384.png 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wordpress-security-2-360x180.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 1460px) 100vw, 1460px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-39464" class="wp-caption-text">WordPress security</figcaption></figure>
<p>We take <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress security</a> very seriously here at Kinsta and have implemented active and passive measures to stop attacks and malicious intent in its tracks. We even offer free hack repair and <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/security-guarantee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">malware removal</a>. If your site is infected our support team is most likely already cleaning it up. We also have software in place to detect <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/what-is-a-ddos-attack/">DDoS attacks</a> as they happen. <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/what-is-a-firewall/#hardware-vs-software-firewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hardware firewalls</a> are in place and have very tight software-based restrictions to protect your WordPress site.</p>
<p>The provider your web host uses is also important. We use Google Cloud Platform which means you get the benefit of a security model that has been built upon over the course of 15 years, and currently secures products and services like Gmail, Search, etc. Google currently employs more than 500 full-time security professionals.</p>
<p>Kinsta also uses Linux containers (LXC), and LXD to orchestrate them, on top of Google Cloud Platform which <strong>enables us to completely isolate not just each account, but each separate WordPress site</strong>. Each site container runs on virtual machines secured behind the GCP firewall. This is a much more secure method than offered by other competitors. On top of that, we employ encryption at rest to store customer data.</p>
<p>Beyond the server-level security, your account is also very important. You should ensure that no matter which hosting route you go that they offer two-factor authentication. If someone gets access to your account they could change your passwords, delete your websites, change DNS records, and all sorts of horrible things. We here at Kinsta partnered up with <a href="https://www.authy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Authy</a> and have <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-two-factor-authentication/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two-factor authentication</a> available from within your MyKinsta dashboard.</p>
<p>If you pick a web hosting provider that offers the above features, not only will it save you time, but it will also give you peace of mind knowing that if anything ever happens that the host has your back! It’s important to invest in <a href="https://kinsta.com/secure-wordpress-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">secure WordPress hosting</a>.</p>
<h2><a id="scaling-wordpress"></a>8. Built with Scalability in Mind</h2>
<p>Another important aspect for any host is scalability. When it comes to shared hosting your only option when you outgrow your resources is to upgrade to a higher plan. And this is if they haven’t already suspended you. Eventually, with a shared host you are going to reach a point where they will simply force you to migrate to a dedicated server. This can simply be time-consuming in itself as you’re constantly having to worry about watching your limits. And moving to a better server might require time on your part.</p>
<p>With the DIY VPS route it’s a lot easier to scale, but sometimes this requires a little more server knowledge to expand disks, etc. With managed WordPress hosting providers they usually handle all of this for you. If you’re going over their pre-defined limits they will simply notify you, and if required, an upgrade is just a click away.</p>
<p>A very cool and unique feature we have at Kinsta is the ability to automatically scale your site due to the fact that we use Google Compute Engine servers. For example, other WordPress hosting providers are typically constrained to 2-6 CPUs per machine. We actually can let the site’s container scale to as many CPUs as needed when there’s a traffic surge. For sites with a large amount of un-cacheable activity or huge traffic surges, we have a <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/dedicated-server/">dedicated server solution</a> as well that allows PHP workers to be scaled beyond the limits on our normal plans.</p>

<p>With our isolated software container technology, hardware resources are allocated to each site container automatically by our virtual machines on an as-needed basis. <strong>No resources are shared between sites. </strong>The result is a hosting configuration that is secure and private by design while simultaneously allowing server resources to scale up or down as needed based on the demands of the site.</p>

<h2><a id="wordpress-roi"></a>9. Premium DNS (Reliable and Faster Lookup Times)</h2>
<p>And last, but definitely not least, is that you should be using a <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/premium-dns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">premium DNS provider</a>. You won’t get that with shared hosting providers or the DIY VPS method. You would have to sign up separately for the service. There actually aren’t a lot of managed hosting providers that even offer this, but Kinsta does! We include premium DNS on all plans via Amazon Route 53.</p>
<p><a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-dns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What is DNS</a>? Well, think of it like a phonebook for the internet. Whenever you type an address into your browser this actually routes back to an IP address, even though you never see it. DNS servers do the mapping for you. Just like with web hosting, there are slow DNS providers and fast ones. Amazon has one of the largest networks in the world. By going with a fast DNS provider you will ensure faster DNS lookup times.</p>
<figure id="attachment_35520" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-35520" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-35520" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-dns-works.png" alt="How DNS works" width="1024" height="303" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-dns-works.png 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-dns-works-300x89.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-dns-works-768x227.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-35520" class="wp-caption-text">How DNS works</figcaption></figure>
<p>Typically the free DNS provided by domain registrars like GoDaddy and Namecheap is very slow. It also might not be consistent and lookup times can vary. Google domains is probably one exception to this rule simply because they have such a large infrastructure. The best DNS providers out there are companies like Amazon, Cloudflare, Dyn, and DNS Made Easy which all have very large infrastructures specifically designed for DNS.</p>
<p>Another reason a reliable DNS provider is important is to protect you from DDoS attacks. And you should know by now from the <a href="http://blog.catchpoint.com/2016/10/23/dyn-dns-outage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DNS Doomsday</a> on Friday, October 21st, 2016, just how important DNS really is. This is a good example actually of why you need multiple DNS providers. Many companies’ websites on that day went completely offline because they relied solely on Dyn, the DNS provider under attack. Companies like Reddit, Twitter, Spotify, all experienced downtime.</p>
<p>One common issue though is that DNS providers typically set high TTLs, which to put it simply means that if one of those companies had added a 2nd DNS provider on that day, it wouldn’t have mattered much because the TTL was set to expire in days not minutes. This can be resolved by simply setting up multiple DNS providers ahead of time in preparation.</p>
<blockquote><p>The community must work together to come up with commercial or open source solutions to make DNS configurations compatible between vendors (this is for complex DNS setups like failover, geo load balancing, etc.). This is a no longer a nice-to-have, but a <em>must-have. – Catchpoint</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So get set up with a premium DNS provider now, not later!</p>

<p>Adjusting your site’s pagination can help you create a more user-friendly, easily navigable website. However, many <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-a-wordpress-theme/">WordPress themes</a> don’t offer detailed pagination options, which means you’re limited in the changes that you can make.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there are some easy ways to adjust WordPress pagination. More advanced users can rely on custom code, while casual users can find several high-quality pagination plugins.</p>
<p>In this post, we will cover everything that you need to know about WordPress pagination.</p>
<p>Let’s dive in!</p>
<p><span><div></div><kinsta-auto-toc heading="Table of Contents" exclude="last" list-style="arrow" selector="h2" count-number="-1"></kinsta-auto-toc></span></p>
<h2>What Is WordPress Pagination?</h2>
<p>WordPress pagination is the process of splitting the list of your website’s blog posts or other content into separate pages.</p>
<p>For example, if you have 100 blog posts, you might configure your pagination settings to show 10 blog posts on each page, which would divide your blog post list into 10 pages with 10 posts each.</p>
<p>Visitors can then use “Next” or “Previous” buttons to navigate between the pages that list your posts. Or, in some cases, visitors will see a numbered list of pages so that they can jump to a specific page. For example, the pagination looks this way in <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/twenty-twenty-one-theme/">the default Twenty Twenty-One theme</a>:</p>
<figure id="attachment_109221" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-109221" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-109221 size-large" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-pagination-example-twenty-twenty-one-1024x589.jpg" alt="An example of WordPress pagination in the default Twenty Twenty-One theme." width="1024" height="589" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-pagination-example-twenty-twenty-one-1024x589.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-pagination-example-twenty-twenty-one-300x173.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-pagination-example-twenty-twenty-one-768x442.jpg 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-pagination-example-twenty-twenty-one.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-109221" class="wp-caption-text">WordPress pagination example in the default Twenty Twenty-One theme.</figcaption></figure>
<p>You can also break a single WordPress post into multiple pages, which can be helpful if you publish <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/long-form-articles/">long-form content</a>.</p>
<p>With some code snippets or plugins, you can also gain a lot more control over how pagination works on your site, which are topics that we’ll cover later in this post.</p>

<h2>Why Use WordPress Pagination?</h2>
<p>There are 3 main reasons you should care about WordPress pagination:</p>
<ol>
<li>Improved navigation and user experience</li>
<li>Better performance</li>
<li>Improved SEO crawlability</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s go through them.</p>
<h3>Improved Navigation and User Experience</h3>
<p>The biggest benefit of improving WordPress pagination is that it makes it <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/website-navigation/">easier for your visitors to navigate your site</a>, which <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/website-usability-testing/">creates a better experience</a> for them.</p>
<p>Many WordPress themes only show limited pagination options, making it difficult for visitors to navigate to a different page.</p>
<p>For example, here are the default pagination options in the Twenty Twenty-One theme when a visitor reads the first page of posts.</p>
<figure id="attachment_109222" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-109222" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-109222" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-pagination-example-twenty-twenty-one-first-page-1024x593.jpg" alt="The Twenty Twenty-One theme provides limited pagination options on the first page." width="1024" height="593" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-pagination-example-twenty-twenty-one-first-page-1024x593.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-pagination-example-twenty-twenty-one-first-page-300x174.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-pagination-example-twenty-twenty-one-first-page-768x445.jpg 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-pagination-example-twenty-twenty-one-first-page.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-109222" class="wp-caption-text">The Twenty Twenty-One theme provides limited pagination options on the first page.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Visitors can navigate to the last page (<em>page 6 in this example</em>) or to the next page (<em>by clicking “Older posts”</em>), but they can’t navigate directly to pages 3, 4, or 5.</p>
<p>Compare that to <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/">the Kinsta blog</a>, which provides multiple pagination links to help visitors get to the right spot.</p>
<figure id="attachment_109233" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-109233" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-109233" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/kinsta-pagination-1024x459.jpg" alt="The Kinsta blog provides more pagination options, which makes it easier for visitors to navigate." width="1024" height="459" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/kinsta-pagination-1024x459.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/kinsta-pagination-300x134.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/kinsta-pagination-768x344.jpg 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/kinsta-pagination.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-109233" class="wp-caption-text">The Kinsta blog provides more pagination options for easier navigation.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Visitors get even more options as they navigate to deeper pages, which helps them quickly jump forward or back to different pages as needed.</p>
<figure id="attachment_109234" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-109234" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-109234" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/kinsta-pagination-deep-1024x458.jpg" alt="Users get more pagination options as they navigate to deeper pages." width="1024" height="458" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/kinsta-pagination-deep-1024x458.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/kinsta-pagination-deep-300x134.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/kinsta-pagination-deep-768x344.jpg 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/kinsta-pagination-deep.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-109234" class="wp-caption-text">Users get more pagination options as they navigate to deeper pages.</figcaption></figure>
<h3>Better Performance</h3>
<p>Using pagination can also be a tactic to <a href="https://kinsta.com/learn/speed-up-wordpress/">improve your WordPress site’s performance</a> by limiting the amount of data that your site needs to load on each page.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you have 50 blog posts. If you try to load all 50 blog posts on your main blog page, your blog page might load slowly because that’s a lot of data.</p>
<p>However, if you use pagination to break up the list into 5 pages of 10 posts each, each page will load much faster because it only needs to load one-fifth of the data.</p>
<h3>Improved SEO Crawlability</h3>
<p>Using pagination can also make it easier for search engine robots like Googlebot to <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/submit-website-to-search-engines/">crawl your site</a> by providing these bots with more navigation links.</p>
<p>It’s a slight difference, but any tweak you can make to improve your site’s crawlability is always a <a href="https://kinsta.com/ebooks/wordpress/how-to-improve-seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">good thing for SEO</a>.</p>
<h2>How to Control WordPress Pagination Manually</h2>
<p>While we’ll get to some handy WordPress pagination plugins in the next section, you also get some built-in features to work with WordPress pagination. Or, depending on your knowledge level, you can also adjust pagination <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/edit-wordpress-code/">using custom code</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about the built-in options for working with pagination, using the default Twenty Twenty-One theme as an example.</p>
<h3>Controlling How Many Content Items to Display Per Page</h3>
<p>By default, WordPress will show 10 posts per page. So if you have 25 posts, you would have 3 total pages. The first 2 pages would show 10 posts each, and the last page would show the remaining 5 posts.</p>
<p>If you want to adjust this number, you can go to <strong>Settings &gt; Reading</strong> and edit the <strong>Blog pages show at most</strong> value.</p>
<figure id="attachment_109216" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-109216" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-109216" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/manual-pagination-posts-per-page-1024x741.jpg" alt="How to change how many posts WordPress displays per page from the settings area." width="1024" height="741" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/manual-pagination-posts-per-page-1024x741.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/manual-pagination-posts-per-page-300x217.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/manual-pagination-posts-per-page-768x556.jpg 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/manual-pagination-posts-per-page.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-109216" class="wp-caption-text">How to change how many posts WordPress displays per page.</figcaption></figure>
<h3>Breaking a WordPress Post or Page Into Multiple Pages</h3>
<p>So far, we’ve mainly focused on breaking your blog listing page into multiple pages. However, WordPress also lets you divide individual posts or pages into various pages, which might be helpful in some situations.</p>
<p>If you’re using <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/gutenberg-wordpress-editor/">the WordPress block editor (AKA Gutenberg)</a>, you can choose where to add page breaks using the <strong>Page Break</strong> block.</p>
<figure id="attachment_109235" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-109235" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-109235" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/manual-pagination-page-break-1024x727.jpg" alt="How to add page breaks with the Page Break block." width="1024" height="727" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/manual-pagination-page-break-1024x727.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/manual-pagination-page-break-300x213.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/manual-pagination-page-break-768x545.jpg 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/manual-pagination-page-break.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-109235" class="wp-caption-text">How to add page breaks with the Page Break block.</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you’re <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/disable-gutenberg-wordpress-editor/">using the classic TinyMCE editor</a>, you can choose where to add page breaks using one of two methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>Place your mouse cursor where you want to add the page break in the <strong>Visual</strong> tab of the editor. Then use the following keyboard shortcut: <strong>Alt + Shift + P</strong>.</li>
<li>Manually place the page break by pasting the following snippet into the <strong>Text</strong> tab of the editor: <code>&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Using PHP and CSS to Adjust WordPress Pagination Behavior</h3>
<p>If you’re not a very technical person, this method probably isn’t for you. You might want to skip ahead to the pagination plugins.</p>
<p>However, if you feel comfortable making minor code tweaks to your site, you can adjust your theme’s pagination using PHP and CSS.</p>
<p>Because you’ll be <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-customize-wordpress-theme/">editing your theme’s template files</a>, you must use a WordPress child theme. Otherwise, your changes will get overwritten the next time you update your theme. We have a <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-child-theme/">detailed guide on how to set up a child theme</a>.</p>
<p>We also recommend <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/backup-wordpress-site/">backing up your site</a> before making any changes.</p>
<p>If you want to add pagination to any WordPress theme manually, you can use the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/the_posts_pagination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the_posts_pagination function</a>. For example, the following snippet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">the_posts_pagination( array(
'mid_size' =&gt; 2,
'prev_text' =&gt; __( 'Previous Page', 'textdomain' ),
'next_text' =&gt; __( 'Next Page', 'textdomain' ),
) );</code></pre>
<p>You would add this snippet directly to your child theme’s template files where you want the pagination to appear.</p>
<p>Below, we’ve left the default Twenty Twenty-One pagination and added our own pagination using the code snippet to see the difference. The “Page 1” pagination is the theme’s default, and the “1”, “2”, “3” pagination comes from our custom code.</p>
<figure id="attachment_109236" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-109236" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-109236" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/manual-pagination-php-1024x691.jpg" alt="An example of the default pagination as well as our own custom pagination." width="1024" height="691" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/manual-pagination-php-1024x691.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/manual-pagination-php-300x202.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/manual-pagination-php-768x518.jpg 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/manual-pagination-php.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-109236" class="wp-caption-text">An example of the default pagination as well as custom pagination.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Here’s what that looks like in the code – you can see the original pagination function and our custom pagination.</p>
<figure id="attachment_109237" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-109237" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-109237" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/manual-pagination-php-code-in-editor-1024x646.jpg" alt="The actual PHP code for the example screenshot above." width="1024" height="646" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/manual-pagination-php-code-in-editor-1024x646.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/manual-pagination-php-code-in-editor-300x189.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/manual-pagination-php-code-in-editor-768x485.jpg 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/manual-pagination-php-code-in-editor.jpg 1358w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-109237" class="wp-caption-text">The actual code for the example screenshot above.</figcaption></figure>
<p>You’d want to replace the existing pagination function with your custom function on a live WordPress site (Warning: We recommend doing it on a <a href="https://kinsta.com/help/staging-environment/">staging site</a> first. This is just an example!). You might need to edit <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/wordpress-files/">multiple files</a> depending on your theme.</p>
<p>You might find it more convenient to connect to your server via <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/best-ftp-clients/">an FTP client</a> and use <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/php-editor/">a dedicated PHP editor</a> to edit your theme files.</p>
<p>To adjust the style of your theme’s pagination, you’ll need to <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-css/">add some custom CSS</a>.</p>
<h2>The Seven Best WordPress Pagination Plugins</h2>
<p>If you want more control over your site’s pagination, you might prefer using a WordPress pagination plugin. Here are 7 of the top options available.</p>
<h3>1. WP-PageNavi</h3>
<figure id="attachment_109224" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-109224" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-109224" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wp-pagenavi-1024x470.jpg" alt="The WP-PageNavi WordPress plugin card." width="1024" height="470" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wp-pagenavi-1024x470.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wp-pagenavi-300x138.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wp-pagenavi-768x352.jpg 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wp-pagenavi.jpg 1292w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-109224" class="wp-caption-text">WP-PageNavi WordPress plugin.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Active on over 700,000 sites, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-pagenavi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WP-PageNavi</a> is the most popular WordPress pagination plugin by a good margin. It’s also 100% free, which helps explain its popularity.</p>
<p>It gives you a simple settings area where you can control the behavior of your site’s pagination. You can adjust the text, how many page numbers to show, and more.</p>			<div class="in-post-container">
				<dialog id="newsletter" class="dialog dialog has-dark-blue-background-color email-modal" aria-hidden="true">
    <div class="dialog__content">
        <h2 class="heading--large text--center color--white mb--30">

    <kinsta-form show-name="false" show-phone="false" show-website="false" show-company="false" show-disk-space="false" show-monthly-visits="false" show-number-of-websites="false" show-message="false" submit-button-text="Sign Up Now" submit-button-text-sending="Signing Up..." success-title="Thanks for subscribing!" success-message="Keep an eye out for our next newsletter." terms-template="newsletter" hubspot-source="subscribe_to_newsletter" submit-button-text-loading="Signing Up"></kinsta-form>

<p>If you want more control over the design of your pagination, you can also consider the third-party <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/styles-for-wp-pagenavi-addon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Styles For WP Pagenavi Addon plugin</a>.</p>
<h4>How It Works</h4>
<p>Because WP-PageNavi is so popular, some <a href="https://kinsta.com/best-wordpress-themes/">WordPress themes</a> offer built-in support for the plugin. If your theme does, all you need to do is activate the plugin, configure its settings, and you’re good to go. You can access the settings by going to <strong>Settings &gt; PageNavi</strong>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_109225" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-109225" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-109225" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wp-pagenavi-settings-1024x983.jpg" alt="The WP-PageNavi settings area." width="1024" height="983" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wp-pagenavi-settings-1024x983.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wp-pagenavi-settings-300x288.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wp-pagenavi-settings-768x737.jpg 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wp-pagenavi-settings.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-109225" class="wp-caption-text">The WP-PageNavi settings area.</figcaption></figure>
<p>However, if your theme doesn’t include built-in support, you’ll need to <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/edit-wordpress-code/">manually edit your theme’s template files</a> to get the plugin working, which can be a little complicated if you’re not a very technical person.</p>
<p>You need to find the default code your theme uses for pagination and replace it with WP-PageNavi’s custom code snippet. The developer explains how to do this on the plugin’s WordPress.org page.</p>
<h3>2. WP-Paginate</h3>
<figure id="attachment_109226" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-109226" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-109226" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wp-paginate-1024x331.jpg" alt="The WP-Paginate WordPress plugin card." width="1024" height="331" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wp-paginate-1024x331.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wp-paginate-300x97.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wp-paginate-768x248.jpg 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wp-paginate.jpg 1292w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-109226" class="wp-caption-text">WP-Paginate WordPress plugin.</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-paginate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WP-Paginate</a> is another popular plugin for setting up custom pagination on your WordPress site. In addition to helping you paginate your posts, you can also use the plugin to add custom pagination to <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-comment-plugins/">your comments sections</a>, which can help you <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-comments/">speed up your comments</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike the WP-PageNavi plugin above, you do <strong>not</strong> need to edit your theme template files directly, which might make this a better option if you’re not a technical person. For more advanced users, you still have the option of using PHP to place the pagination in your theme’s template files manually.</p>
<p>With the plugin, you’ll be able to customize all aspects of your pagination, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Labels and buttons</li>
<li>Placement</li>
<li>How many navigation items to display</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a free version at WordPress.org that should work for most sites. There’s also a $19 premium version that adds more pre-set styles and style options.</p>
<h4>How It Works</h4>
<p>To configure the plugin, you can go to <strong>Settings → WP-Paginate</strong> to control the plugin’s settings.</p>
<p>If you want to display the plugin’s pagination without editing your theme’s template files, you’ll want to make the following selections in the <strong>Location & Position</strong> settings:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check the<strong> Everywhere</strong> box to display your new pagination everywhere where pagination is needed.</li>
<li>Set the <strong>Position</strong> drop-down equal to <strong>Below the Content</strong>.</li>
<li>Check the <strong>Hide Standard Pagination</strong> box to hide your theme’s existing pagination.</li>
</ol>

<h3>3. Pagination by BestWebSoft</h3>
<figure id="attachment_109218" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-109218" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-109218" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pagination-by-bestwebsoft-1024x331.jpg" alt="The Pagination by BestWebSoft WordPress plugin card." width="1024" height="331" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pagination-by-bestwebsoft-1024x331.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pagination-by-bestwebsoft-300x97.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pagination-by-bestwebsoft-768x248.jpg 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pagination-by-bestwebsoft.jpg 1290w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-109218" class="wp-caption-text">Pagination by BestWebSoft WordPress plugin.</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/pagination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pagination by BestWebSoft</a> is another pagination plugin that lets you add a new pagination system to your site without needing to edit your theme’s template files.</p>
<p>However, like the WP-Paginate plugin above, you still have the option to edit your theme’s template files if you want more control over placement.</p>
<p>Via the plugin’s settings, you’ll be able to easily adjust the location, style, and behavior of your pagination.</p>			<div class="in-post-container">
			<div id="simple-promo">
  <div class="mb--20 mt--0 heading--normal">
  <p>Need blazing-fast, reliable, and fully secure hosting for your ecommerce website? Kinsta provides all of this and 24/7 world-class support from WooCommerce experts. <a onclick="gtag('event', 'click', {'event_category': 'blog-article', 'event_label': 'blog-inarticle-minimaltext'})" href="https://kinsta.com/plans/?in-article-cta">Check out our plans</a></p>  </div>
</div>
			</div>

<p>The free version should work fine for most sites, but a $20 premium version also adds more pagination types and built-in Divi compatibility.</p>
<h4>How It Works</h4>
<p>To configure the plugin, go to the new <strong>Pagination</strong> tab in your dashboard.</p>
<p>The plugin’s default settings will automatically hide your theme’s existing pagination and replace it with the custom pagination from the plugin. All you need to do is configure the settings for the style and behavior of your new pagination.</p>
<figure id="attachment_109217" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-109217" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-109217" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pagination-bestwebsoft-settings-1024x928.jpg" alt="The Pagination plugin's settings area." width="1024" height="928" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pagination-bestwebsoft-settings-1024x928.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pagination-bestwebsoft-settings-300x272.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pagination-bestwebsoft-settings-768x696.jpg 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pagination-bestwebsoft-settings.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-109217" class="wp-caption-text">The Pagination plugin’s settings area.</figcaption></figure>
<h3>4. Ajax Load More</h3>
<figure id="attachment_109230" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-109230" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-109230" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ajax-load-more-1024x331.jpg" alt="The Ajax Load More WordPress plugin card." width="1024" height="331" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ajax-load-more-1024x331.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ajax-load-more-300x97.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ajax-load-more-768x248.jpg 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ajax-load-more.jpg 1292w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-109230" class="wp-caption-text">Ajax Load More WordPress plugin.</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ajax-load-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ajax Load More</a> lets you create buttons that load more content without forcing the user to load a new page. It gives you several options for controlling pagination, including “traditional” pagination and some unique twists.</p>
<p>If you’re willing to purchase some premium add-ons, you can add actual pagination buttons. When users move to a new page, they won’t perceive the page as reloading, but the URL will change (good for SEO). You can <a href="https://connekthq.com/plugins/ajax-load-more/examples/seo-paging-add-ons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see a live demo of this here</a>.</p>
<p>Ajax Load More lets you replace your pagination with a “Load More” button with the free version. Instead of adding pagination links that visitors can use to navigate to a different page, Ajax Load More lets you add a “Load More” button to display more posts without reloading the page. You can <a href="https://connekthq.com/plugins/ajax-load-more/examples/default/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see a live demo of this here</a>.</p>
<h4>How It Works</h4>
<p>Instead of adding pagination to your existing post list, the Ajax Load More plugin works by creating a new post list that includes your desired settings. To set this up, you’ll use the <strong>Ajax Load More</strong> area in your WordPress dashboard.</p>
<p>If you want to set up traditional pagination, make sure to purchase and install <a href="https://connekthq.com/plugins/ajax-load-more/add-ons/paging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Paging add-on</a>.</p>
<h3>5. Alphabetic Pagination</h3>
<figure id="attachment_109231" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-109231" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-109231" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alphabetic-pagination-1024x331.jpg" alt="The Alphabetic Pagination WordPress plugin card." width="1024" height="331" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alphabetic-pagination-1024x331.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alphabetic-pagination-300x97.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alphabetic-pagination-768x248.jpg 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alphabetic-pagination.jpg 1292w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-109231" class="wp-caption-text">Alphabetic Pagination WordPress plugin.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/alphabetic-pagination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alphabetic Pagination</a> plugin helps you implement a different type of pagination on your site – an A-Z listing.</p>
<p>Rather than paginating by numbers and ordering posts by their publish dates, Alphabetic Pagination lets you create a pagination option for each letter of the alphabet. Then, if a user clicks on a specific letter, they’ll see all of the content pieces that start with that letter.</p>
<h4>How It Works</h4>
<p>To use the plugin, head to <strong>Settings &gt; Alphabetic Pagination </strong>to configure its settings.</p>
<p>In the <strong>General</strong> tab of the plugin’s settings, you can configure where to display your alphabetic pagination.</p>
<p>Using the <strong>Auto</strong> implementation is the simplest option. However, you can also manually place your alphabetic pagination using the <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-shortcodes/">shortcodes</a> or PHP function in the <strong>Shortcodes</strong> tab.</p>
<figure id="attachment_109232" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-109232" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-109232" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alphabetic-pagination-settings-1024x752.jpg" alt="The settings area for the Alphabetic Pagination plugin." width="1024" height="752" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alphabetic-pagination-settings-1024x752.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alphabetic-pagination-settings-300x220.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alphabetic-pagination-settings-768x564.jpg 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/alphabetic-pagination-settings.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-109232" class="wp-caption-text">How to configure the placement of your alphabetic pagination.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Once you’ve configured the placement, you can control the design of your alphabetic pagination from the <strong>Styling</strong> tab.</p>
<h3>6. WP Show Posts</h3>
<figure id="attachment_109238" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-109238" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-109238" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wp-show-posts-1-1024x339.jpg" alt="The WP Show Posts WordPress plugin card." width="1024" height="339" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wp-show-posts-1-1024x339.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wp-show-posts-1-300x99.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wp-show-posts-1-768x254.jpg 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wp-show-posts-1.jpg 1438w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-109238" class="wp-caption-text">WP Show Posts WordPress plugin.</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-show-posts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WP Show Posts</a> is a helpful plugin that lets you create your post lists, complete with custom pagination.</p>
<p>That’s the key detail — you’re <strong>not</strong> adding pagination to your existing blog post list. Instead, you’re creating a <strong>new</strong> blog post list that includes your own pagination settings.</p>
<p>The plugin also includes a flexible <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wp-query/">query builder</a> so that you can choose exactly which posts to show (and therefore which posts you want to paginate).</p>
<h4>How It Works</h4>
<p>Once you activate the plugin, you can go to <strong>WP Show Posts &gt; Add New</strong> to create a new post list.</p>
<p>We recommend exploring all of the settings to control what content to display. In setting up pagination, check the <strong>Pagination</strong> box in the <strong>Posts</strong> tab and set the number of <strong>Posts per page</strong>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_109229" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-109229" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-109229" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wp-show-posts-settings-1024x593.jpg" alt="How to create a new post list with pagination." width="1024" height="593" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wp-show-posts-settings-1024x593.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wp-show-posts-settings-300x174.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wp-show-posts-settings-768x445.jpg 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wp-show-posts-settings.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-109229" class="wp-caption-text">How to create a new post list with pagination.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Once you’ve set everything up, you can add your post list using its shortcode or PHP function.</p>
<h3>7. Pagination Styler for WooCommerce</h3>
<figure id="attachment_109219" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-109219" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-109219" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pagination-styler-for-woocommerce-1024x331.jpg" alt="The Pagination Styler for WooCommerce WordPress plugin card." width="1024" height="331" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pagination-styler-for-woocommerce-1024x331.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pagination-styler-for-woocommerce-300x97.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pagination-styler-for-woocommerce-768x249.jpg 768w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pagination-styler-for-woocommerce.jpg 1468w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-109219" class="wp-caption-text">Pagination Styler for WooCommerce WordPress plugin.</figcaption></figure>
<p>As the name suggests, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/pagination-styler-for-woocommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pagination Styler for WooCommerce</a> is a pagination plugin specifically for <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/woocommerce-tutorial/">WooCommerce stores</a>.</p>
<p>It gives you many new options for controlling your store’s product pagination positioning and style. You can also choose from completely different layouts, such as vertical pagination instead of the traditional horizontal pagination.</p>
<h4>How It Works</h4>
<p>Pagination Styler for WooCommerce works by replacing your existing WooCommerce pagination with the plugin’s pagination.</p>
<p>To configure the plugin’s settings, you can go to <strong>BeRocket &gt; Pagination Styler</strong> in your WordPress dashboard:</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Pagination lets you split your WordPress site’s content into multiple pages. This can make it easier for humans and search engines to navigate, and it can also improve performance by loading less data on each page.</p>
<p>All WordPress sites come with pagination support out of the box. However, the default pagination system in most themes is limited.</p>
<p>To improve WordPress pagination, you can add your custom code or use one of the 7 WordPress pagination plugins that we detailed above.</p>

<h2>Why Picking the Right WordPress Theme Is Important</h2>
<p>If there’s one thing you can do for your site, you should spend time carefully picking a suitable <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-statistics/#themes-statistics" rel="noopener">WordPress theme</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_108971" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-108971" style="width: 1353px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-108971 size-full" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-themes.jpg" alt="WordPress themes" width="1353" height="829" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-themes.jpg 1353w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-themes-300x184.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-themes-1024x627.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-themes-768x471.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1353px) 100vw, 1353px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-108971" class="wp-caption-text">WordPress themes</figcaption></figure>
<p>Knowing how to choose a WordPress theme is the foundation of your entire website, as the first thing your visitors will take in is your layout, navigation, color palette, <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/best-google-fonts/">font</a>, <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/optimize-images-for-web/">images</a>, and other aesthetic choices.</p>
<p>If you make an excellent first impression, they’re more likely to stick around to read the content. Make a bad one with poor design or prolonged <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/google-pagespeed-insights/">page speeds</a>, and they’ll quickly click off your site before it can even finish loading.</p>
<p>Think of it like decorating a physical store. A pleasant atmosphere can draw you in and keep you coming back for more. The same is true of your website’s design. A unique and well-made site can undoubtedly influence the number of repeat visitors, leads, and customers you get.</p>

<h2>What to Consider When Selecting a WordPress Theme</h2>
<p>When <a href="https://kinsta.com/tools/wordpress-theme-detector/" rel="noopener">picking a theme</a>, it can be overwhelming to narrow it down. You’ll likely end up with a dozen potential choices and no idea which one is best. Luckily, some considerations can help you eliminate most options.</p>
<h3>Features to Look For</h3>
<p>Every theme is different, and there are various features to pick from. Some are simply cosmetic, but others can be important for your site’s actual functionality.</p>
<p>We’ll go over features to look out for in-depth below, but for now, here’s a quick list of what to look out for.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Small Size</strong> – Rather than a theme packed with features, it’s best to go with one that advertises itself as sleek and lightweight with minimal file size and few to no plugin dependencies.</li>
<li><strong>Customization</strong> – Some themes come essentially pre-made and don’t give you many options to change up the design. That means your site will look just like the thousands of others using this theme. Go with one that has plenty of <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-customize-wordpress-theme/" rel="noopener">customization options</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility</strong> – It’s always a good idea to use themes that work with screen readers and are friendly to other assistive devices. It’ll help a good portion of your visitors and also help with SEO because Google gives an SEO boost to accessible websites.</li>
<li><strong>Plugin Support</strong> – Themes supporting popular must-have plugins like <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/fastest-woocommerce-theme/">WooCommerce</a>, BuddyPress, <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-page-builders/">page builders</a>, and contact form plugins (depending on your needs) are always welcome.</li>
<li><strong>Multilingual</strong> – Pick a translation-ready theme that supports non-Latin characters.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Appearance Preferences</h3>
<p>It may go without saying, but one thing you should be asking yourself while picking a theme is what you want it to look like. Try to envision your site, make a list of cosmetic features you want, and perhaps even sketch a mockup.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure how to design it, take a look at similar sites. If you’re <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/best-blogging-platform/">making a blog</a>, how do your favorite blogs look? How do bloggers make their sites unique? If you’re designing a store, check out some of the popular ecommerce shops in your industry.</p>
<p>You may even want to do a little research and make a list of pros and cons. Take note of any clever design choices you noticed. What was best about these sites? Was there anything particularly appealing about the design or layout? Was navigating easy and painless? And was there anything you didn’t like?</p>
<p>Most of all, try to think about how you can add your touch to wow visitors. You don’t want to break from the mold — common industry design elements exist for a reason — but it’s a good idea to think about adding your spin to things.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Feature Filter</a> in the WordPress theme repository. You can choose from various features like sidebar location, column, layout type, and header/footer.</p>
<figure id="attachment_108973" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-108973" style="width: 987px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-108973" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-theme-features.png" alt="Feature Filter on the WordPress theme repository" width="987" height="583" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-theme-features.png 987w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-theme-features-300x177.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-theme-features-768x454.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 987px) 100vw, 987px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-108973" class="wp-caption-text">Feature Filter on the WordPress theme repository</figcaption></figure>
<p>Other sites like <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/themeforest-pros-cons/" rel="noopener">Themeforest</a> may not have such filters if you choose to use them instead, but this can give you an idea of what sort of general design you’re looking for.</p>
<h3>Free vs Paid</h3>
<p>When it comes to <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-free-vs-paid-themes/" rel="noopener">free and paid themes</a>, many would say the choice is obvious if you’re building a professional site that may not be true.</p>
<p>Those on the side of paid WordPress themes claim that free themes have poorer quality code, less appealing designs, and are generally not trustworthy.</p>
<p>Premium themes are one the most significant contributors to the bloat epidemic. Paying money is no guarantee that you’re getting something sleek, professional, and coded by proficient developers.</p>
<p>Nothing stops any random developer with minimal experience from throwing together a theme with code copied off the internet and selling it on ThemeForest. Code quality has little to do with whether an addon is free or paid and more to do with the people who made it.</p>
<p>Premium software also tends to be loaded with tons of unnecessary features, leaving your site broken when you try to switch down the line.</p>
<p>That said, paid themes can have some upsides. If you find a professional development studio, then you may end up with a more beautiful and well-coded theme that’s worth the money. You’re also guaranteed support and updates, while free developers may not have time to continue supporting software released at no cost.</p>
<p>In addition, free themes are extremely popular. If you want to look a little more unique, getting a paid theme is an excellent way to do it.</p>
<figure id="attachment_108974" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-108974" style="width: 1417px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-108974" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/premium-wordpress-themes.jpg" alt="WordPress themes on ThemeForest" width="1417" height="371" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/premium-wordpress-themes.jpg 1417w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/premium-wordpress-themes-300x79.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/premium-wordpress-themes-1024x268.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/premium-wordpress-themes-768x201.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1417px) 100vw, 1417px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-108974" class="wp-caption-text">WordPress themes on ThemeForest</figcaption></figure>
<p>But premium themes aren’t automatically better than free ones. Browse through free and paid ones, read reviews, do your research, and pick what you like best and think most suits your site.</p>
<h3>After-Market Modification (Custom Code or Child Themes)</h3>
<p>After you install your theme, there’s a good chance you’ll need to edit it to add in features or tweak existing ones. You don’t need to worry much if you’re using the built-in tools to swap out a color palette and upload a logo, but serious code edits have unique considerations.</p>
<p>In this case, you should either use a <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/change-wordpress-theme/" rel="noopener">staging site</a> or a <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-child-theme/" rel="noopener">child theme</a> if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>The problem is that some themes don’t support child themes, or may even attempt to restrict customization. Ensure your theme supports code editing and child themes before you lock yourself in.</p>
<h2>Tips for How to Choose a WordPress Theme</h2>
<p>Need some more guidance? The ideas above can give you a general idea of what to look out for, but these tips will help you narrow things down. Here are a few key things you want in your themes.</p>
<h3>1. Simplicity</h3>
<p>Many themes will try to dazzle you with flashy designs and thousands of features, and it’s easy to fall for the trap. But often, <a href="https://kinsta.com/best-wordpress-themes/" rel="noopener">the best theme</a> is the simplest one — the one that does its job and nothing more or less.</p>
<figure id="attachment_108975" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-108975" style="width: 1334px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-108975" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/simple-wordpress-theme.jpg" alt="Twenty Twenty-One WordPress theme" width="1334" height="806" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/simple-wordpress-theme.jpg 1334w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/simple-wordpress-theme-300x181.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/simple-wordpress-theme-1024x619.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/simple-wordpress-theme-768x464.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1334px) 100vw, 1334px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-108975" class="wp-caption-text">Twenty Twenty-One WordPress theme</figcaption></figure>
<p>A simple look can go a long way, and for non-designers, it’s often the best choice and the one that’s easiest to work with. A pleasing layout, a few tasteful animations, plenty of customization options, and you have yourself a great theme.</p>
<p>It may not be the most memorable website your visitors ever see, but you also aren’t going to get a unique, knockout design with a $40 WordPress theme either way. Over-the-top designs do nothing but slow down your site and overwhelm visitors with way too much content.</p>
<p>The most important thing is that your site is functional, readable, and does its job, while not looking generic and bland. Pick a theme that’s beautiful but simple, with enough features to add your touch to it without going off the rails.</p>
<h3>2. Release Frequency</h3>
<p>You may think that it’s OK to use any theme as long as it’s well-coded and not full of obvious problems. But the truth is, a theme that was top of the line three years ago may today be full of outdated code and <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/website-security-check/">glaring security vulnerabilities</a>.</p>
<p>The internet is ever-evolving. Every year, coding standards are updated and leave your current theme’s HTML full of conflicts. Plus, <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/php-8-1/" rel="noopener">new versions of systems like PHP</a> are released regularly. And existing vulnerabilities become apparent as hackers discover them.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s not a good idea to use addons that haven’t been updated in over two years. Over time, more and more bugs and security issues will become apparent, and you’ll have no support if you can’t update to the latest PHP version.</p>
<p>Weekly or even monthly updates aren’t necessary, but you should expect a few updates a year to fix bugs and address vulnerabilities.</p>
<figure id="attachment_108976" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-108976" style="width: 958px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-108976 size-full" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-theme-updates.png" alt="Update log for Twenty Twenty-One" width="958" height="210" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-theme-updates.png 958w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-theme-updates-300x66.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-theme-updates-768x168.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-108976" class="wp-caption-text">Update log</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s a good idea to look at the support forums and see if issues are being resolved to this day. If the theme hasn’t been updated in several years and the support forums are full of unresolved complaints, it’s best to move on.</p>
<h3>3. Size</h3>
<p>The problem with feature-packed themes is that they can instantly bloat your site and leave your load times extremely slow, and that’s all before you do any customization or <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/how-to-install-wordpress-plugins/">install plugins</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/fastest-wordpress-theme/" rel="noopener">Lightweight themes</a> are always best. Themes below 200-600 KB can be called truly small, while anything around 2-3MB is in an acceptable range. Anything more indicates a very likely case of bloated software full of features you’ll never use.</p>
<p>While this isn’t a universal rule, you want your site to start as small as possible as the page size will inevitably increase as you add in content and start installing plugins.</p>
<h3>4. Responsiveness</h3>
<p>Every theme worth its salt will list itself as responsive. You’re likely well aware of the mobile boom; <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/779/mobile-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">90% of internet users browse with a mobile device</a>. Whether that’s a phone, tablet, or smartwatch, there are a variety of different screen sizes out there.</p>
<p>The solution is responsive design, websites that adapt to your screen size. Before purchasing a theme, it’s worth visiting the demo page on your phone or at least resizing your browser window and seeing how it looks on smaller screens.</p>
<p><a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/optimize-images-for-web/">Images should scale properly</a>, and the layout change without any strange effects. If a theme isn’t responsive, it’s simply not worth using.</p>
<h3>5. Compatible Plugins</h3>
<p>It’s rare to find a plugin and theme that don’t go together, but incompatibilities exist. Carefully read over the documentation to see if any wanted plugins don’t play well with your theme of choice.</p>			<div class="in-post-container">
				<dialog id="newsletter" class="dialog dialog has-dark-blue-background-color email-modal" aria-hidden="true">
    <div class="dialog__content">
        <h2 class="heading--large text--center color--white mb--30">

    <kinsta-form show-name="false" show-phone="false" show-website="false" show-company="false" show-disk-space="false" show-monthly-visits="false" show-number-of-websites="false" show-message="false" submit-button-text="Sign Up Now" submit-button-text-sending="Signing Up..." success-title="Thanks for subscribing!" success-message="Keep an eye out for our next newsletter." terms-template="newsletter" hubspot-source="subscribe_to_newsletter" submit-button-text-loading="Signing Up"></kinsta-form>
    </div>
</dialog>
<div class="box box--noshadow has-gray-background-color newsletter-cta">

  <a href="#newsletter" data-dialog-src="#newsletter" class="button button--purple newsletter-cta__button">

</div>
			</div>

<p>More than that, you may want to look out for themes that integrate with certain plugins. While a theme that outright requires dozens of plugins can be a red flag, it can be a nice bonus to know that it will work well with popular <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-caching-plugins/" rel="noopener">caching</a>, <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-security-plugins/" rel="noopener">security</a>, and <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-ecommerce-plugins/" rel="noopener">ecommerce</a> plugins.</p>
<h3>6. Ratings and Reviews</h3>
<p>It’s always a good idea to check out the ratings. Reading through reviews can give you a good insight into what most people like and dislike about the theme, and what features are most impactful.</p>
<figure id="attachment_108977" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-108977" style="width: 1061px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-108977 size-full" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-theme-rating.jpg" alt="WordPress theme reviews" width="1061" height="785" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-theme-rating.jpg 1061w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-theme-rating-300x222.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-theme-rating-1024x758.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-theme-rating-768x568.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1061px) 100vw, 1061px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-108977" class="wp-caption-text">WordPress theme reviews</figcaption></figure>
<p>For a more balanced look at the theme, please pay attention to three and four-star reviews as users are more likely to give a reasonable explanation of what they liked and disliked. And of course, two-star and one-star reviews could give you an idea of what isn’t so great.</p>
<p>You can also search for third-party reviews that can go in-depth, but look out for people using <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/affiliate-program/">affiliate links</a> and find an unbiased source that tried out the theme.</p>
<p>These won’t help you know what it’s like to use it long-term, but they should at least give you an idea of how appealing the design is and how easy it is to work with.</p>
<h3>7. SEO-Optimized</h3>
<p>It’s always a good idea to pick an SEO-optimized theme, but it can be hard to tell at a glance whether it fits this criterion. Most SEO optimization goes on under the hood and has to do with the underlying structure of the page.</p>
<p>While every theme will say that it’s SEO-optimized, not all of them are. Unless you’re versed in <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/html-vs-html5/">HTML5</a>, you might not know how to tell if it’s genuinely made well.</p>
<p>Still, SEO-friendly themes generally have small sizes (fast speeds), responsive design, and good HTML structuring.</p>
<p>Look for tells like <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">improperly nested headings</a>/multiple H1 headings, confusing navigation menus, and <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">messy HTML code</a> to know that a page’s structure is poor.</p>
<p>Remember that most <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-seo/" rel="noopener">SEO optimization</a> involves creating high-quality content, so it is primarily on you.</p>
<h3>8. Secure</h3>
<p>Much like with SEO, every theme will say it’s safe and secure, but there’s no way to test this claim without being familiar with code. And unlike SEO, there are no easy tells of a poorly secured theme without digging through the source code.</p>
<p>You can use a tool like a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Theme Check(er) plugin</a> or an online scanner like <a href="https://sitecheck.sucuri.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sucuri SiteCheck</a>. These are most effective when tested on your site.</p>
<figure id="attachment_108978" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-108978" style="width: 1058px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-108978" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/theme-security-check.png" alt="Theme security check notifications" width="1058" height="300" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/theme-security-check.png 1058w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/theme-security-check-300x85.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/theme-security-check-1024x290.png 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/theme-security-check-768x218.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1058px) 100vw, 1058px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-108978" class="wp-caption-text">Theme security check notifications</figcaption></figure>
<p>There’s no need to be alarmed if there are just a few issues, as it’d be impossible to code a theme that threw no warnings at all, and not all are the theme’s fault. But if you’re seeing several prominent notices pop up, it may be time to switch.</p>
<p>There’s also the issue of themes themselves coming bundled with malware. To avoid this, stick with reputable vendors like the official WordPress theme repository or popular third-party ones like TemplateMonster or ThemeForest. Don’t install software from unknown sites without much research, and <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/nulled-wordpress-plugins-themes/" rel="noopener">avoid pirated/nulled themes</a>.</p>
<h3>9. Translation Ready</h3>
<p>If you plan on translating your site and making it available to people worldwide, it’s imperative to pick a theme that lists itself as “<a href="https://translatepress.com/how-to-translate-wordpress-theme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">translation ready</a>.”</p>			<div class="in-post-container">
			<div id="simple-promo">
  <div class="mb--20 mt--0 heading--normal">
  Struggling with downtime and WordPress problems? Kinsta is the hosting solution designed to save you time! <a onclick="gtag('event', 'click', {'event_category': 'blog-article', 'event_label': 'blog-inarticle-minimaltext'})" href="https://kinsta.com/features/">Check out our features</a>  </div>
</div>
			</div>

<p>Such themes have the files in place to let you reference your translation files and swap out text on the page as needed, as well as working with RTL languages and non-Latin alphabets. That might sound simple, but it’d be an absolute nightmare to set up on your own.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t plan on translating your site right now, you never know if down the line you’ll end up with several hundred thousand visitors and might want to start thinking of localizing your content and bringing in international visitors.</p>
<p>Instead of having to switch to a new theme or pay a developer to get it translation-ready, pick one that’s already done the work for you.</p>
<h2>WordPress Themes to Avoid</h2>
<p>You now know what to look for in a theme, but what are the things you want to avoid? Even popular themes like <a href="https://avada.theme-fusion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Avada</a>, the <a href="https://themeforest.net/category/wordpress?sort=sales" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">top-selling theme on ThemeForest</a>, aren’t exempt from bloat.</p>
<p>While themes that fit these criteria aren’t always strictly bad, you should be careful if the one you’re considering is too large, has an unnecessarily massive feature list, or one of these other issues.</p>
<h3>1. Bloated</h3>
<p>Theme bloat is a severe problem for you and your visitors. A theme packed to the brim with features isn’t likely to be very user-friendly, and these will massively inflate its size.</p>
<p>A poorly optimized theme can single-handedly ruin your website speeds. All those features may sound great on paper, but a gigantic theme packed with stuff you’ll never use will affect your performance.</p>
<figure id="attachment_108979" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-108979" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-108979" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/long-feature-list.png" alt="Bloated WordPress themes make your website slower" width="900" height="785" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/long-feature-list.png 900w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/long-feature-list-300x262.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/long-feature-list-768x670.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-108979" class="wp-caption-text">Bloated WordPress themes make your website slower.</figcaption></figure>
<p>As already mentioned, lightweight themes can be below 1MB, while it’s rare for a well-optimized one to go far over 2-3MBs. Mega themes and “toolkits” like Avada can clock out at <a href="https://theme-fusion.com/documentation/avada/technical/are-you-sure-you-want-to-do-this/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 8MBs</a> and counting, so large that some web hosts won’t even let you upload them directly.</p>
<p>The WordPress core, with all its functionality, is just over 8MBs. Think about just how much clutter must be stuffed into what’s intended to be a simple aesthetic template for it to match or exceed the size of WordPress itself.</p>
<p>That’s why you should pick well-optimized themes that do their job and leave the actual functionality to plugins.</p>
<h3>2. Too Many Options</h3>
<p>A common sight when you visit a theme description is a massive list of features that seem to go on and on. But this is a good thing, right? Why purchase something simple when you can get all of these features for the same price?</p>
<p>The truth is, those endless feature lists with dozens of premade templates and hundreds of bundled plugins are a sign of a bloated theme that will more than likely slow your site to a crawl.</p>
<p>These so-called “multipurpose” themes have too many problems to list.</p>
<p>You’ll never use all of these several hundred tiny features, but they’re still there, bloating the file size and slowing down your site. Plus, more features equal more potential security holes. That’s why you should use a lightweight theme and only install the plugins you need!</p>
<p>Themes like Avada, which come with features like a custom-made website and form builder, lead to an issue known as “theme lock-in.” It may seem like a good idea to skip paying for plugins, but when you eventually try to switch to a new theme, you’ll find that your site is completely broken and filled with strange layout issues and ugly shortcodes.</p>
<figure id="attachment_108980" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-108980" style="width: 1351px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-108980" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/avada-custom-builders.jpg" alt="Live visual builder within Avada" width="1351" height="870" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/avada-custom-builders.jpg 1351w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/avada-custom-builders-300x193.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/avada-custom-builders-1024x659.jpg 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/avada-custom-builders-768x495.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1351px) 100vw, 1351px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-108980" class="wp-caption-text">Live visual builder within Avada</figcaption></figure>
<p>That’s why you should avoid themes that come with <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-custom-post-types/" rel="noopener">custom post types</a>, shortcodes, or any significant functionality like contact forms or builders and use a plugin instead.</p>
<p>Finally, premade templates are also not always a good thing. They bloat the price and the theme size, and are generally useless unless you’re throwing together a site in 24 hours and don’t plan to replace any of the demo images or content.</p>
<p>A few templates with different layouts can be pretty helpful, but a hundred demos for every possible niche are excessive and unnecessary.</p>
<figure id="attachment_108981" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-108981" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-108981" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/avada-prebuilt-sites.jpg" alt="Prebuilt demos in the Avada theme" width="900" height="508" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/avada-prebuilt-sites.jpg 900w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/avada-prebuilt-sites-300x169.jpg 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/avada-prebuilt-sites-768x433.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-108981" class="wp-caption-text">Prebuilt demos in the Avada theme</figcaption></figure>
<p>Avada sells itself on having <a href="https://theme-fusion.com/documentation/avada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">550+ pages of documentation</a>, but for a tool meant to provide a simple design base for your site, that seems like way too much.</p>
<p>If you need the functionality, it’s far better to rely on plugins that can easily be turned off than to hook them into your website’s most crucial back-end support that will be extremely difficult to swap out later.</p>
<h3>3. Inactive Support</h3>
<p>Inactive support is never a good sign. Whether you need help <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-install-a-wordpress-theme/" rel="noopener">installing a theme</a> or fixing a bug that suddenly crops up, it’s always good to have the official developers to turn to. And if there’s no support, that’s a good sign that it isn’t being updated anymore.</p>
<p>If you’re using a theme from the WordPress repository, it’s effortless to see if it’s being supported by visiting its page, scrolling down, and viewing the support forum. Topics with a checkmark have been resolved, so it’s likely not supported well if you don’t see any checks.</p>
<figure id="attachment_108982" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-108982" style="width: 1355px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-108982" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-theme-support.png" alt="WordPress theme support forum" width="1355" height="615" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-theme-support.png 1355w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-theme-support-300x136.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-theme-support-1024x465.png 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wordpress-theme-support-768x349.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1355px) 100vw, 1355px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-108982" class="wp-caption-text">WordPress theme support forum</figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, support on third-party sites is often less transparent. Themes may have support forums where you can manually check to see if topics are getting resolved, but it’s a lot harder to see if support is currently active.</p>
<h3>4. Inaccessible</h3>
<p>Finally, it’s crucial to avoid themes that aren’t <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-accessibility/">built with accessibility in mind</a>. This will cause problems for assistive device users and be time-consuming to fix by yourself, even if you’re familiar with code.</p>
<p>Themes may say they’re accessible, but make sure they list specific steps they’ve taken. This may include screen reader optimization, keyboard shortcuts, or special features like <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/twenty-twenty-one-theme/">Twenty Twenty One’s </a>contrast color picker.</p>
<figure id="attachment_108983" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-108983" style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-108983" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twenty-twenty-one-accessibility-features.png" alt="Accessibility features in the Twenty Twenty-One theme" width="900" height="211" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twenty-twenty-one-accessibility-features.png 900w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twenty-twenty-one-accessibility-features-300x70.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twenty-twenty-one-accessibility-features-768x180.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-108983" class="wp-caption-text">Accessibility features in the Twenty Twenty-One theme</figcaption></figure>
<p>Before installing, <a href="https://accessiblewpthemes.com/check-your-theme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check if it’s accessible</a> yourself or run the demo through an <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">automated accessibility checker</a>.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Slow, bloated themes are a big problem in WordPress. It’s an issue that can cost you heavily, making it extremely difficult to move away from the theme in the future without breaking your site.</p>
<p>Avoid themes with massive feature lists and instead stick with simple, lightweight ones that come with just the essentials. There are plenty of themes out there that are functional and beautiful without bogging themselves down with a hundred unnecessary features.</p>
<p>Look for themes that are simple, responsive, SEO-optimized, secure, and <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-update-wordpress-theme/" rel="noopener">regularly updated</a>. Avoid heavy and bloated ones with way more features than you’re ever likely to use.</p>

<p>These two file types couldn’t be more different — each is better suited for specific situations. They’re certainly not interchangeable in every aspect, but you may find that SVGs can perform specific tasks better than the standard PNG image.</p>

<h2>What Is SVG?</h2>
<p>SVG stands for <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/what-is-an-svg-file/" rel="noopener">Scalable Vector Graphics</a>, and it’s the most widely used vector file format on the web. Let’s break this down:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scalable:</strong> SVGs can be resized up or down without damaging the quality of the image. It will be perfectly crisp and clear, no matter how large or small it is.</li>
<li><strong>Vector:</strong> Most image file types contain pixels. Vectors are essentially pieces of code that render an image in real-time, converting it to the pixels you see on your screen. While they display the same image, what goes on in the background is very different.</li>
<li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Though it may not be as well known, SVG is an image file type like PNG, JPEG, or GIF. It just goes about things a little differently.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vectors are pieces of code written in XML that represent shapes, lines, and colors to elaborate on how it works.</p>
<p>While creating an image with nothing but code is entirely possible, most people use a vector graphics editor like Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator. You can also <a href="https://convertio.co/png-svg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">convert PNGs</a> or other raster images to SVG, but the results aren’t always great.</p>

<p>When the page loads, this code is converted into graphics, so you can’t immediately tell an SVG from a PNG. But because SVGs are simply lines of code converted to pixels, that means they can scale to any resolution — large or small — <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/lossy-compression/">without losing quality</a>.</p>

<p>SVG also supports animation and transparency, making it a versatile file format.</p>
<p>The only issue is that it’s not as widely used as more standard formats like PNG, so it’s less supported on older browsers and devices, and it’s not always the easiest to upload it to your site and get it to display correctly.</p>

<h3>Pros and Cons of SVG</h3>
<p>Though still not as widely used as raster file types like PNG, vector graphics are growing fast in popularity. They do some essential tasks that raster images just can’t. Here’s why people love SVGs.</p>
<ul>
<li>SVG images are scalable. You can design it at any resolution, and it will size up or down without damaging the quality or becoming pixelated. With raster images, you need to know what size you want from the beginning, or you could risk making the image too large or too small.</li>
<li>SVGs always look crisp and beautiful due to never experiencing quality loss. Raster images can start to look blurry when even slightly resized.</li>
<li>As SVGs are just code, their file size is <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/optimize-images-for-web/">minimal and well-optimized</a>. SVG optimizers also exist to make them even more manageable. Your site will likely load a little faster if you use them instead.</li>
<li>Unlike PNGs, SVGs support animation.</li>
</ul>
<p>SVG has quite a bit on PNG, from being scalable to tinier in size, but it’s not better in every situation. Here’s the bad of vector file types.</p>
<ul>
<li>While SVGs enjoy support on all major, modern browsers, you can run into compatibility issues rendering them on older browsers and devices. If a significant chunk of your visitors uses those, switching over could be a bad idea.</li>
<li>SVGs are harder to work with, requiring special programs to create and edit. While you can design them with nothing but XML, this isn’t always feasible. Premium tools like Adobe Illustrator can be expensive.</li>
<li>SVGs aren’t nearly as easy to embed as PNGs. If you’re using WordPress, it isn’t supported by the default <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-media-library/">media library</a>, so you’d need a plugin to upload them at all.</li>
<li>SVGs must be rendered by the browser when the page is loaded, so using an excess of them or a large file with many vectors can tax the device.</li>
</ul>
<h3>When to Use SVG Over PNG</h3>
<p>While you definitely shouldn’t convert all your PNGs to SVGs, vector graphics can make an excellent replacement for some images.</p>
<p>SVG images work exceptionally for decorative website graphics, logos, icons, graphs and diagrams, and other simple images. See <a href="https://kinsta.com/" rel="noopener">our homepage</a> for an excellent example of vector artwork in action.</p>
<figure id="attachment_108841" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-108841" style="width: 1347px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-108841 size-full" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/svg-animation.png" alt="svg animation on the Kinsta homepage" width="1347" height="490" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/svg-animation.png 1347w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/svg-animation-300x109.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/svg-animation-1024x373.png 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/svg-animation-768x279.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1347px) 100vw, 1347px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-108841" class="wp-caption-text">The Kinsta homepage.</figcaption></figure>
<p>However, they don’t work as well with complex images involving many colors and shapes, such as screenshots, <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/photography-website/">photography</a>, and even detailed artwork. While it’s possible to convert any image to SVG, browsers don’t always handle complex vectors with hundreds of colors well since they have to be rendered when the page loads.</p>
<p>In addition, SVG artwork can be beautiful, but designing complex images requires a lot of time, effort, and proficiency in advanced editing tools. Keep it simple if you want to create your vector images.</p>
<p>If you have detailed images, definitely stick with PNG.</p>
<p>However, SVGs are better for responsive and retina-ready web design due to their scalability and lack of quality degradation. In addition, they support animation while PNG doesn’t, and raster file types that support animation like GIF, APNG, and <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/webp/">WebP</a> all have their issues.</p>
<p>For simple graphics that may require animation and are guaranteed to scale well on any screen size, use SVG.</p>
<h2>What Is PNG?</h2>
<p>PNG stands for Portable Network Graphics, and this name is reflected in how widespread this file type is. Anyone who’s ever used a computer has likely worked with PNGs, as it’s the most common file type on the internet next to <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/jpg-vs-jpeg/" rel="noopener">JPEG</a>.</p>
<p>PNG is a raster image file type, similar to most common image formats. That means that it consists of pixels, the same small dots displayed on your monitor or screen. While this makes it easy to display, it also means image quality is dependent on the resolution — how many pixels are in the image.</p>			<div class="in-post-container">

<p>So if you scale a raster image up or down in size, the quality will be impacted. Sometimes the damage is negligible, especially when scaling down, and sometimes it can make an image blurry and completely unusable.</p>
<figure id="attachment_108842" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-108842" style="width: 1509px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-108842" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zoomed-in-png.png" alt="zoomed in png" width="1509" height="729" srcset="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zoomed-in-png.png 1509w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zoomed-in-png-300x145.png 300w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zoomed-in-png-1024x495.png 1024w, https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zoomed-in-png-768x371.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1509px) 100vw, 1509px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-108842" class="wp-caption-text">Example of an enlarged PNG.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Still, the prevalence of PNG makes it a good candidate for general-purpose usage. This file type supports transparency, but not animation.</p>
<h3>Pros and Cons of PNG</h3>
<p>What makes PNG the most widely used image file format online? Here are the advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>PNG files are easily editable and opened in any common image editing tool. There’s no need to pay for advanced programs to create or change a PNG image; at most, you may need to download a free editor like GIMP.</li>
<li>Whether you’re coding from scratch or using the WordPress media manager, displaying PNG images on your site is a simple task.</li>
<li>PNG uses <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/optimize-images-for-web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lossless compression</a> that leaves it looking crisper than lossy compression JPEGs. However, this does come at a larger file size cost, and it can’t compare to vector images.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, the PNG format was created decades ago and has several notable flaws that haven’t been updated for the modern era.</p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot resize PNG files without losing quality. You need to plan carefully when designing raster graphics and make sure it’s the <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-image-sizes/" rel="noopener">right size</a>, or you may end up wasting time making unusable images.</li>
<li>PNGs are very large due to their lossless compression. Thus, they can slow down your website. Fixing this requires compressing it even more and damaging the quality.</li>
<li>Making images “retina-ready” is more tedious with PNGs and more likely to cause blurriness.</li>
<li>PNG does not support animation. Other animated raster file types like GIFs can have serious problems; for instance, GIFs are super low quality and only support 256 colors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>When to Use PNG Over SVG</h3>
<p>PNG is the most common file type for a reason; it’s highly versatile and fits almost any situation. There are just a few flaws to consider when using it, like their large file size and lack of scalability.</p>
<p>PNGs are suitable for displaying detailed images, artwork, and photography — everything a vector image can’t handle. Anything with hundreds of colors and a large resolution should likely be a PNG.</p>			<div class="in-post-container">

</div>
			</div>

<p>That’s not to say you cannot use PNGs for more straightforward images like logos and decorative graphics, but SVGs would be better suited for the task.</p>
<p>When you’re not sure whether a platform will handle the newer, less supported SVG file type, PNG is the way to go — if only to be safe.</p>
<p>For instance, you can’t upload SVGs to most <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/social-media-image-sizes/" rel="noopener">social media</a>. And as some email clients may struggle with vectors, it’s usually recommended to stick with PNGs in email templates.</p>
<p>In general, PNGs work well with any complex, non-animated images, especially ones that require transparency. You can use it pretty much anywhere; it’s just that sometimes an SVG would be a better fit.</p>
<p>Remember that you can always use <a href="https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-svg-fallbacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PNG fallbacks</a> if your SVG fails to load, so it’s usually safe to go with vectors even if a significant portion of your user base has stuck with older devices or browsers.</p>
<h2>Which Is Best: SVG or PNG?</h2>
<p>Neither file type is better or worse than the other; each has its limitations. Though SVG outperforms PNG in several areas, PNG is a lot better at handling certain things.</p>
<p>In general, though, you should stick to SVGs wherever appropriate and use PNGs in all other situations that vectors cannot handle. You may be technically able to use either in these cases, but SVG is preferable in a few specific areas.</p>
<p>While SVG supports animation, PNG does not. Raster file types like GIF and APNG can be considered alternatives. Still, there is no perfect animated raster format that’s widely supported, well known, high quality, and results in small file sizes. SVGs satisfy all these niches.</p>
<p>SVGs also <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/responsive-web-design/">scale perfectly to any screen size</a>, making them responsive and retina-ready by default. PNGs will lose quality when resized, and getting them to scale well is a hassle — especially if you only have tiny images that won’t display well on large screens.</p>
<p>Finally, SVGs are generally smaller than PNGs, so they’re less taxing on your server despite needing to render on load.</p>
<p>Use them for simple, flat color artwork, logos, and decorative graphics on your site.</p>
<p>On the other hand, PNGs are suitable for displaying complex graphics at a large resolution, or pictures with thousands of colors. SVGs can’t handle that amount of colors and shapes at the moment.</p>
<p>These sort of complex images will often make up the majority of pictures on your site, so it’s not time to toss out PNG yet.</p>
<p>And PNGs are more widely supported on browsers and specific platforms like <a href="https://kinsta.com/email-market-share/">email clients</a>. If you’re not sure whether an SVG will render properly, err on the side of caution and use a PNG.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>SVG and PNG are two very different file formats. In the end, it’s not a big deal whether you use PNGs or JPEGs on your site outside of very niche use cases, but picking between SVG and PNG is a much more important choice.</p>
<p>You’re far more likely to use PNGs as it’s a simpler, easier to access, and more versatile file format. Complex images such as screenshots and detailed illustrations should use PNG.</p>
<p>While SVGs are harder to create and edit, they have a variety of benefits over PNGs. Whenever it’s appropriate to use vector images, such as decorative graphics and logos, definitely use SVG.</p>
<p>You won’t likely be swapping out every single image on your site for an SVG, but their responsiveness and smaller file sizes make them a great candidate in certain situations.</p>

<h2>What Is a Frontend Developer?</h2>
<p>A frontend developer uses code to implement a website or application design.</p>
<p>Their primary tools are <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/html-vs-html5/">HTML</a>, <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-css/">CSS</a>, and <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-javascript/">JavaScript</a> — HTML for the website’s general structure and content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for advanced interactivity.</p>
<h3>What Is Frontend Development?</h3>
<p>Frontend development is the development of the website’s user interface. Anything that the user can view or interact with (like the layout, images, menus, or login form) is considered the site’s frontend.</p>
<p>The other primary type of web development is backend development. The user doesn’t see a backend developer’s work, but it makes the website possible. The backend of a site includes servers, databases, backend logic, and APIs.</p>

<p>You’ll also hear the term full-stack development. Full-stack developers are generalists who do both frontend and backend development.</p>

<h2>What Does a Frontend Developer Do?</h2>
<p>A frontend developer builds and maintains the frontend of a website or application. Examples of the parts of a website they work on include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Layout</li>
<li>Navigation features</li>
<li>Images</li>
<li>Video</li>
<li>Buttons</li>
<li>Search box</li>
<li>Login page</li>
<li>Social media integration</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Are the Responsibilities of a Frontend Developer?</h3>
<p>A frontend developer is responsible for building a website or application that provides an enjoyable user experience. That means it looks good and functions the way it’s supposed to.</p>
<p>Frontend developers usually aren’t responsible for the design of the site. However, they will work closely with UI and UX designers to turn their ideas into reality.</p>
<p>Once the site or app is built, frontend developers are responsible for maintenance, testing, and ongoing developments like feature upgrades.</p>
<h2>What Skills Do You Need to Be a Frontend Developer?</h2>
<p>Every frontend developer needs to be skilled with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Those three languages are the foundation of almost everything you’ll do.</p>
<p>You’ll need other skills, too, but the same skill set required will vary from job to job.</p>
<p>The list below covers some of the most common skills required for frontend development jobs. Knowing as many as possible will make you the best candidate for a broad range of positions.</p>
<h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
<p><a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/edit-wordpress-code/">HTML and CSS</a> go hand-in-hand and are the building blocks of website design.</p>
<p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It defines the structure of a web page. For example, you’ll use HTML to indicate where headers go, where to put a paragraph break, and where to insert an image. All the text and images you’re seeing on this very page are all thanks to HTML.</p>
<p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it deals with style. For example, CSS might dictate the background color or font. You can use a single CSS stylesheet to define styles across a site (i.e. multiple pages at once).</p>
<p>A good frontend developer is experienced with HTML and CSS and can quickly understand how to use them together to create a design.</p>
<p>Luckily, HTML and CSS are pretty easy to learn. But truly mastering them can take time.</p>
<p>Once you’ve picked up the basics, you can practice your coding skills by looking at existing websites and trying to clone the layout and features you see.</p>
<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<p>While HTML sets the framework and CSS defines style, JavaScript makes a website interactive.</p>
<p>If a website is doing more than displaying static information, it’s probably thanks to JavaScript. For example, you can use JavaScript to create a map that updates in real-time or to animate part of your website.</p>
<p>According to a StackOverflow survey, JavaScript is the programming language <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#most-popular-technologies-language-prof" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">used the most </a>by professional web developers. The next most popular language is HTML/CSS.</p>
<figure>
<p><figure style="width: 921px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-56.png" alt="Programming languages used by professional developers in the last year " width="921" height="701"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Programming languages used by professional developers in the last year (<b>Source:</b> <a href="//insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#most-popular-technologies-language-prof%E2%80%9D">insights.stackoverflow.com</a>)</figcaption></figure></p></figure>
<p>JavaScript is more complex than HTML or CSS, but is still one of the more accessible programming languages. Expect that you can learn it in a matter of months.</p>
<h3>React and Other JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks</h3>
<p><a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/javascript-libraries/">JavaScript libraries and frameworks</a> are tools that make JavaScript development faster and easier.</p>
<p>A JavaScript library is a set of reusable codes that you can put into your project. It saves you the trouble of developing a feature from scratch when other developers have already done it.</p>
<p>There are over 83 libraries in existence, each of which has a specific purpose. For example, Chart.js is a library that allows you to create charts and graphs for your website easily.</p>
<p>A JavaScript library that you should be familiar with is React. React is a free, open-source library maintained by Facebook. It’s used to build user interfaces for single-page applications and is currently the most popular JavaScript library.</p>
<p>JavaScript frameworks are similar to libraries. They both provide reusable code, but the usage is a bit different.</p>
<p>When you use a library, you’re in charge of the flow of the application. You decide where in your code to call a library component.</p>
<p>With frameworks, you’re plugging your code into the framework. Instead of your code calling the library, the framework calls your code at designated points.</p>
<p>A couple of popular frameworks to be familiar with are <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/php-vs-angular">Angular.js</a> and <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/vue-js/">Vue.js</a>.</p>
<h3>Node.js</h3>
<p><a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-node-js">Node.js</a> is often mistakenly called a framework or a programming language, but it’s a runtime environment for frontend and backend development.</p>
<p>Typically, the user’s browser renders JavaScript. Node.js lets you run your JavaScript code outside of a browser.</p>
<p>Node.js is popular because it makes web development more efficient. It allows programmers to create the frontend and backend of an application using a single programming language.</p>
<p>You might have to use Node.js in your frontend developer job, so it’s a good thing to learn. You can <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-install-node-js/">download and install it yourself</a> so that you can practice.</p>
<h3>Ajax</h3>
<p>Ajax is short for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/admin-ajax-php/#what-is-the-adminajxphp-file">Ajax isn’t a technology by itself</a>, but a set of programming techniques.</p>
<p>Ajax is about asynchronous development. That means that you can update the web content on a portion of a webpage without reloading the entire page.</p>
<p>A typical example is auto-complete. When you start typing a search query into Google, the search engine will offer you auto-complete options. It can do this without reloading the entire search results page.</p>
<p>Many frontend developer jobs call for familiarity with Ajax concepts. Once you’ve mastered JavaScript, online tutorials can teach you how to use it for Ajax.</p>
<h3>Other Programming Languages</h3>
<p>Depending on the project you’re working on, you may want to know other <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/best-programming-language-to-learn/">programming languages</a> beyond JavaScript.</p>
<p>For example, TypeScript is an increasingly popular programming language developed by Microsoft. Typescript is a superset of JavaScript. Unlike JavaScript, it was designed to create enterprise-level applications.</p>
<p>JavaScript is an essential language to know, but once you’re proficient with it, you can look into other possibilities like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Typescript</li>
<li>Elm</li>
<li>Flow</li>
<li>Dart</li>
<li>Purescript</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing a programming language or two beyond JavaScript can set you apart as a job candidate.</p>
<h3>Bootstrap</h3>
<p>We’ve talked about frameworks and libraries for JavaScript.</p>
<p>CSS also makes use of frameworks. The most important one is Bootstrap.</p>			<div class="in-post-container">
				<dialog id="newsletter" class="dialog dialog has-dark-blue-background-color email-modal" aria-hidden="true">
    <div class="dialog__content">
        <h2 class="heading--large text--center color--white mb--30">

    <kinsta-form show-name="false" show-phone="false" show-website="false" show-company="false" show-disk-space="false" show-monthly-visits="false" show-number-of-websites="false" show-message="false" submit-button-text="Sign Up Now" submit-button-text-sending="Signing Up..." success-title="Thanks for subscribing!" success-message="Keep an eye out for our next newsletter." terms-template="newsletter" hubspot-source="subscribe_to_newsletter" submit-button-text-loading="Signing Up"></kinsta-form>
    </div>
</dialog>
<div class="box box--noshadow has-gray-background-color newsletter-cta">
  <div class="newsletter-cta__content">

      </div>
  <a href="#newsletter" data-dialog-src="#newsletter" class="button button--purple newsletter-cta__button">

</div>
			</div>

<p>Bootstrap is a free collection of reusable pieces of code written in HTML, CSS, and (optionally) JavaScript. It lets developers quickly build fully mobile-responsive websites.</p>
<p>As a frontend developer, it’s helpful to have at least a basic knowledge of Bootstrap. There are many online courses and tutorials available but don’t dig in until you’ve developed a strong understanding of HTML and CSS.</p>
<h3>Content Management Systems (CMS)</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/content-management-system/">Content Management System</a> is software that helps users create, edit, and manage content on a website without the need for technical skills.</p>
<p>For example, you can type up a blog post and add it to your site without worrying about the HTML and CSS used to display the post.</p>
<p>WordPress is by far the most popular CMS. Others you’ll come across include Drupal, Joomla!, and Ghost.</p>
<p>As a frontend developer, you’ll often work on websites that use a CMS. Working knowledge of these platforms is a marketable skill.</p>
<p>You may also be able to do some work creating new <a href="https://kinsta.com/best-wordpress-themes/">themes for WordPress</a> or other Content Management Systems.</p>
<h3>RESTful Services and APIs</h3>
<p>An API (Application Programming Interface) allows an application or service to access a resource within another application or service.</p>
<p>For example, a developer might want to integrate weather data into their website. They could use an API that reaches out to a weather service and gets the data.</p>
<p>RESTful APIs are a type of API that conforms to the constraints of the REST (Representational State Transfer) architectural style and allows for connection to RESTful web services.</p>
<p>As a frontend developer, you won’t need to write your APIs for others to call (that’s a backend job), but you should know how to call an API and display it meaningfully on your site.</p>
<h3>Mobile-Responsive Design</h3>
<p>These days, visitors to a website use a wide variety of browsers and devices.</p>
<p>It’s not enough for a website to look good on a laptop screen when mobile devices account for <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">54.8%</a> of global website traffic.</p>
<p>Some websites will have separate versions for desktop and mobile versions, but more commonly, you’ll need to <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/responsive-web-design/">build the site to be mobile-responsive</a>.</p>
<p>A responsive website is designed to render well on any device, window, or screen size.</p>
<figure>
<p><figure style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-62.png" alt="Mobile adaptive vs mobile responsive design screenshot" width="900" height="498"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Mobile adaptive vs mobile responsive design.</figcaption></figure></p></figure>
<p>It matters whether a website is mobile-responsive. <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/adobe/2019-adobe-brand-content-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">45%</a> of consumers will abandon any piece of content displaying poorly on the device they are using.</p>
<p>Since there’s no such thing as a website that doesn’t need to work on mobile anymore, understanding responsive design principles is a non-negotiable skill for a frontend developer.</p>
<p>Responsive design is accomplished through HTML and CSS. It’s not intuitive, but many online courses and resources are available.</p>
<h3>Cross-Browser Testing and Development</h3>
<p>A website needs to look good and work right on any browser. While Chrome is the <a href="https://kinsta.com/browser-market-share/">most popular browser</a>, developers shouldn’t overlook Safari, Edge, or Firefox.</p>			<div class="in-post-container">
			<div id="simple-promo">

</div>
			</div>

<p>Part of your job as a frontend developer will be to ensure that your work looks good on any major browser. That means understanding the differences between browsers and testing your designs on them.</p>
<p>You can read up on cross-platform development on popular coding resource sites. You should also practice. When you do projects on your own, please don’t neglect to test them in multiple browsers.</p>
<p>There are also tools available to help you do cross-browser testing. A few that have free versions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.lambdatest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LamdaTest</a></li>
<li><a href="https://saucelabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sauce Labs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.browserstack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BrowserStack</a></li>
<li><a href="https://crossbrowsertesting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CrossBrowserTesting</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Version Control Systems</h3>
<p>A version control system helps you keep track of changes made to your website’s code. You can use them to revert to an earlier code version if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>That can save a lot of time in case of an error. Instead of finding the problem and manually undoing it, you can roll back the project to an earlier version.</p>
<p>Version control systems are also essential for collaboration. They allow multiple users to work on the same project without conflicting versions.</p>
<p>Git is the most popular version control management system and will be needed for many development jobs, whether frontend, backend, or full-stack. Get started learning by <a href="https://kinsta.com/help/git/">installing Git </a>and creating an account on <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-github/">GitHub.com</a>.</p>
<h2>How to Become a Frontend Developer</h2>
<p>The most important qualification for <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-become-a-web-developer">becoming a frontend developer</a> is proficiency with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a few of the other skills listed above. Without coding ability, nothing else on your resume matters.</p>
<p>These days, it’s possible to learn coding on your own using online resources.</p>
<p><a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#experience-learn-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">40.39%</a> of current web developers took an online coding course, 31.62% learned from online forums, and 59.53% used other online resources like blogs or videos.</p>
<p>To learn web development, check out sites like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3Schools</a></li>

<p>It’s possible to teach yourself code, but that doesn’t mean your formal education doesn’t matter. Many frontend developer jobs prefer or even require that you have a related degree. If you don’t have one, you’ll have to make sure your <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/portfolio-website/">web development portfolio</a> speaks for itself.</p>
<p>So, how do you create a portfolio if you don’t have work experience?</p>
<p>One way to show off your frontend development skills is to build websites and applications independently. Create a tool related to your interests or see if anyone you know needs development work done.</p>
<h2>Are Frontend Developers in Demand?</h2>
<p>Becoming a web developer is a great career move. We can expect to see <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/web-developers.htm#tab-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8% job growth</a> in the next decade. That’s around 13,400 job openings per year — much faster growth than the average profession.</p>
<p>Both frontend and backend developers are in demand, but there are slightly more job openings for frontend developers. On Indeed.com, there are currently <a href="https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=front%20end%20developer&l&vjk=d213491bfff43a0f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">14,600</a> open frontend developer jobs in the U.S., while 12,300 are available for backend developers.</p>
<h2>What’s the Average Frontend Developer Salary?</h2>
<p>According to Glassdoor, the average salary for someone with a <span style="font-size: 1rem">frontend developer title is </span><a style="font-size: 1rem" href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/front-end-developer-salary-SRCH_KO0,19.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$86,088</a><span style="font-size: 1rem">.</span></p>
<p>That’s not the whole story, though.</p>
<p><a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/web-developer-salary/">Web developer salaries</a> can vary wildly depending on the type of company, the skills needed for the job, your location, and your experience level. You can expect to make a higher salary if you stick with it for years. People with the title senior frontend developer make an average of $107,276.</p>

<h2>What to Look for When Hiring a Frontend Developer</h2>
<p>Many web developers are out there, but the truly talented ones are hard to find.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/hire-wordpress-developer/">hiring a frontend developer</a>, here’s what to keep in mind.</p>
<h3>Technical Skills</h3>
<p>Every frontend development job is different. Go into the hiring process to understand the exact mix of skills you’re looking for.</p>
<p>That said, web development is a constantly changing field. If you’re going to be working with this developer long-term, their commitment to learning new skills is even more important than their current skill set.</p>
<p>You can test candidates’ technical skills by giving them a short coding test. If they do well, it’s also helpful to assign a small (paid) test project. Use it to evaluate their attention to detail, the creativity of their solutions, and how well they communicate with team members.</p>
<h3>Other Skills</h3>
<p>In addition to coding skills, a good frontend developer understands the importance of the user experience.</p>
<p>Frontend developers create the elements of a website that users interact with. They aren’t UX designers themselves, but a good frontend developer knows how to make a positive experience for website visitors.</p>
<p>Your frontend developer should also have strong interpersonal skills. They’ll work with other team members and stakeholders and communicate effectively about projects.</p>

<p>The person responsible for this behind-the-scenes work is called a backend developer.</p>
<p>If that sounds like a job you might want, we have good news: <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/backend-developer-salary/">backend development is a well-paying career</a> with a great job outlook.</p>
<p>But how do you get started? What skills do you need to learn?</p>
<p>This article introduces backend development and lets you know how you can start as a developer.</p>

<h2>What Is a Backend Developer?</h2>
<p>Users do not directly access the backend of an application or computer system.</p>
<p>Technology like servers, databases, and APIs allows features such as a user interface to work.</p>
<p>Backend developers build and maintain that technology. Users might not even be aware of the backend developer’s work, but without it, the website or app won’t work.</p>
<h3>Backend Developer vs Frontend Developer</h3>
<p>Frontend web developers work on the parts of the website that the user sees and interacts with. This is also sometimes called client-side or browser-side development.</p>
<p>Backend (or server-side) developers provide the infrastructure to back that up.</p>
<p>While frontend and backend developers often work together, they have a different arsenal of programming languages and skills.</p>
<p>For example, the languages front web developers primarily work with are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While coding, they have to think about the user experience. How do the images look? Is the site accessible? Does it function well on all major browsers?</p>
<p>Backend developers use programming and scripting languages like <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/python-object-oriented-programming/">Python</a>, <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/best-programming-language-to-learn/#ruby">Ruby</a>, and <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/php-vs-angular/#php-vs-angular-frontend-vs-backend">PHP</a>. They focus on concerns like whether the site is secure or how data will be managed.</p>
<figure>
<p><figure style="width: 940px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-50.png" alt="The difference between front end and back end development" width="940" height="677"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The difference between frontend and backend development.

<p>There’s another kind of developer called a <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/full-stack-developers-salary/">full-stack developer</a>. Full-stack means that you do both backend and frontend development.</p>
<p>It might sound like knowing all sides of web development is better than limiting yourself to one, but many jobs are looking for specialists.</p>

<h2>What Does a Backend Developer Do?</h2>
<p>A backend web developer works on the server, <a href="https://kinsta.com/help/create-database-backup/">database</a>, and APIs behind a web application.</p>
<p>The job description is different from a frontend developer’s, but the two roles work together to create work that’s both functional and user-friendly.</p>
<p>For example, a frontend developer creates a page on a website with a button that a customer can click to retrieve data about their past orders.</p>
<p>The backend developer would write the code that allows the button to fetch the right data from the database. That data is delivered back to the frontend, where the frontend developer determines how it’s displayed to the visitor.</p>

<h3>Backend Developer Job Description</h3>
<p>Every backend developer job will be a bit different. In general, backend developers will take on tasks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing backend infrastructure for websites and web applications</li>
<li>Maintaining existing backend</li>
<li>Troubleshooting and fixing bugs</li>
<li><a href="https://kinsta.com/wordpress-staging/">Managing hosting environments</a></li>
<li>QA testing</li>
<li>Working with frontend developers to transfer data efficiently to client-side web applications</li>
<li>Collaborating with clients and departments like product management, marketing, sales, or customer service to develop solutions</li>
<li>Updating documentation on architecture, processes, and systems</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Become a Backend Developer?</h2>
<p>Learning to be a backend developer will take time and commitment. You might be wondering if it’s all worthwhile.</p>
<p>Backend development can be a lucrative and satisfying career field. Here are a few reasons why.</p>
<h3>Demand for Backend Developers</h3>
<p>Web development is a rapidly growing field.</p>
<p>Across all web development specialties, <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/web-developers.htm#tab-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8%</a> job growth is expected in the next decade. That’s around 13,400 job openings per year — much faster growth than average.</p>
<h3>Backend Developer Salary</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/web-developer-salary/">average salary </a>for someone with the job title “Backend Developer” is <a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Back_End_Developer%2F_Engineer/Salary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$81,161</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, you can expect to make more money as you gain experience. For example, the average entry-level backend developer makes $61,042, while the average backend developer with five to nine years of experience makes $95,000.</p>
<p>The average salary for someone with the title “Senior Backend Developer” is $113,687.</p>
<h3>Backend Developer Career Satisfaction</h3>
<p>Money and job opportunities are great, but you want a job that you actually enjoy.</p>
<p>The good news is that most backend developers are happy with what they do.</p>
<p>Backend developers rate their career satisfaction as <a href="https://www.careerexplorer.com/careers/back-end-developer/satisfaction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">better than average</a>.</p>
<p>(In case you were wondering, the survey showed that they’re slightly more satisfied than frontend developers and just as satisfied as full-stack developers.)</p>
<h2>Backend Developer Skills and Programming Languages</h2>
<p>Every backend developer job requires a slightly different skill set.</p>
<p>The skills and <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/best-programming-language-to-learn/">programming languages</a> listed below are in demand for backend developers and will make you a competitive candidate.</p>
<p>It’s also a good idea to have a basic understanding of core frontend skills like <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/html-vs-html5/">HTML</a> and <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-css/">CSS</a>. Even though you won’t use them for backend work, you’ll need to be knowledgeable enough to communicate with your frontend developer colleagues about them.</p>
<figure>
<p><figure style="width: 921px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-66.png" alt="A chart showing programming languages used by professional developers in the last year" width="921" height="701"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Programming languages used by professional developers in the last year. (<b>Source:</b> <a href="//insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#most-popular-technologies-language-prof%E2%80%9D">StackOverflow</a>)</figcaption></figure></p></figure>
<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<p>In terms of popularity, <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-javascript/">nothing beats JavaScript</a>.</p>
<p>It’s the most commonly used programming language in the StackOverflow poll above, and it’s also the most <a href="https://madnight.github.io/githut/#/pull_requests/2021/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">popular language</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>One reason JavaScript tops the list is that it’s useful for both frontend and backend developers. While its most common use is as a scripting language rendered by browsers, the <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/node-js-developer-salary/">NodeJS</a> runtime environment lets web developers use it for backend development as well.</p>
<p>That being said, it’s not as essential for aspiring backend developers as it is for frontend developers.</p>
<p>Start with JavaScript if you already know it from frontend work or if you want to become a full-stack developer. Otherwise, it’s more logical for a beginner to prioritize skills like <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/python-tutorials/">Python</a> and <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/sql-injection/">SQL</a>.</p>
<h3>Python</h3>
<p>Python is a programming language that every backend developer should know. It’s used by major companies like Instagram, Spotify, and DropBox, and its popularity continues to rise.</p>
<p>Currently, it’s the second most frequently used language on <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-github/">GitHub</a> after JavaScript.</p>
<p>Python has a relatively simple syntax that makes it easy to learn and easy for developers to communicate about their code. It supports multiple programming styles and provides clear data visualization.</p>
<p>Python has several frameworks that are used to simplify the development process. Learning a common framework like Django or CherryPy would also be a useful skill for a backend developer.</p>
<h3>SQL</h3>
<p>Standard Query Language (SQL) was released in 1979 and deemed an industry-standard language by the American National Standards Institute in 1986.</p>
<p>It can seem pretty clunky today, but it’s as essential for developers as ever.</p>
<p>SQL’s primary purpose is to interface with databases. Almost every website will require database management, and SQL is capable of handling large amounts of data. Examples of database management systems that use SQL are <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/mariadb-vs-mysql/">MySQL, MariaDB</a>, SQLite, and PostgreSQL.</p>
<p>Familiarity with a few of those systems will be useful for a backend developer.</p>
<p>An open-source platform like MySQL provides free access to SQL database source code and can help you learn the language.</p>
<h3>Ruby</h3>
<p>Ruby is an open-source interpreted scripting language. It was created to be simple and efficient for developers. Its syntax is a lot like regular English, so it’s not hard to learn.</p>
<p>It’s not as popular as Python or JavaScript, but you’ll find plenty of jobs that require it.</p>
<p>When people talk about Ruby, they sometimes mean Ruby on Rails. They’re not the same thing, but they are related. Both are useful backend development skills.</p>
<p>Ruby on Rails is an open-source web development framework that was programmed in Ruby. It’s known for facilitating fast development and is used in over <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/what-is-ruby-on-rails-used-for-tips-from-back-end-developers-85e12780d3cf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">350,000</a> websites globally.</p>			<div class="in-post-container">

<h3>PHP</h3>
<p>Around <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">79%</a> of websites use Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) as their server-side programming language. Most notably, <a href="https://kinsta.com/php-market-share/">WordPress uses PHP</a>.</p>
<figure>
<p><figure style="width: 1600px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-71.png" alt="Sites that commonly use PHP, including CMS sites and social platforms" width="1600" height="844"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Sites that commonly use PHP, including CMS sites and social platforms.</figcaption></figure></p></figure>
<p>PHP has lost some ground to other languages, <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/php-vs-python/">especially Python</a>. In fact, people have been asking, “<a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/is-php-dead/">Is PHP dead?</a>” for at least a decade.</p>
<p>Let us clear that up; it’s not. PHP is fast, powerful, and widespread in backend web development.</p>
<h3>.NET</h3>
<p>.NET (pronounced “dot net”) is a software development framework created by Microsoft in 2002. It includes various coding languages, libraries, and editors. The .NET language most useful to backend developers is C#, one of the most widely used languages today.</p>
<p>It’s used by many well-known websites like Starbucks and match.com.</p>
<p>While .NET isn’t as essential as JavaScript or Python, it’s a good skill to have in your toolbox as a backend developer. Microsoft provides <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tutorials</a> to get you started.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<p><a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/java-developer/">Java</a> sounds like it would be closely related to JavaScript, but it’s not.</p>
<p>Java is a general-purpose programming language, and while it can run on a browser, it’s primarily intended for backend development.</p>
<p>Java isn’t as easy to learn as some newer languages, and its performance isn’t as good. Overall, its popularity is in decline. But you’ll still see it used for plenty of websites, and there’ll be backend developer jobs that require it.</p>
<p>Don’t count Java out yet.</p>
<h3>SOAP and REST APIs</h3>
<p>An API (Application Programming Interface) allows an application or service to access a resource within another application or service.</p>
<p>For example, APIs are used by travel booking sites that aggregate information from various airlines and hotels. The API gets data from the flight or hotel provider and displays it on the travel website. If someone books a flight, the API will confirm it with the booking site.</p>
<p>Two common API paradigms are SOAP and REST. As a backend developer, it will be helpful to understand both.</p>
<p>SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a standards-based protocol that was originally developed by Microsoft. It uses XML to make requests and receive responses.</p>
<p><a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-rest-api/">RESTful APIs</a> are based on the REST (Representational State Transfer) architectural style. Unlike SOAP, REST doesn’t require <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/wordpress-import-issues/">XML</a> — you can obtain output in a language that works well for your project. For example, it could use CSV, JSON, or RSS.</p>
<p>REST is faster than SOAP, and many developers find it easier to work with. However, SOAP has higher security than REST and includes built-in retry logic to compensate when communication fails.</p>
<h3>NoSQL</h3>
<p>We mentioned above that a lot of developers don’t care for SQL.</p>
<p>There are alternatives. NoSQL refers to databases that store information in ways other than a relational table. NoSQL isn’t a language itself but a collection of database storage options that don’t use the traditional model.</p>			<div class="in-post-container">

</div>
			</div>

<p>The most commonly used NoSQL databases include:</p>
<ul>
<li>MongoDB</li>
<li>Cassandra</li>
<li>Amazon DynamoDB</li>
<li>Apache HBase</li>
</ul>
<p>While NoSQL databases can be useful and developers often prefer not to use SQL, NoSQL isn’t nearly as popular as SQL.</p>
<p>It’s <a href="https://kinsta.com/developer-roles/coding-skills-at-kinsta/">a skill that looks good</a> on a resume — but you should learn SQL first.</p>
<h3>Content Management Systems (CMS)</h3>
<p>Most websites use a <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/content-management-system/">Content Management System (CMS)</a> to create, modify, and manage content. A CMS lets the website owner work on their own site, even if they don’t have any technical skills.</p>
<figure>

<p>As a backend developer, you know how to create a website without a content management system. But many of the websites you work on will have one or need to have one implemented. Backend developers are often called in to add new CMS features or debug an existing CMS.</p>
<p>You might even create a CMS from scratch. But most of the time, you’ll work with the existing popular content management systems, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress</li>
<li><a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-vs-drupal/">Drupal</a></li>
<li>Joomla!</li>
<li>Magento</li>
<li>Wix</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s worth becoming an expert on developing for at least one of these platforms (Hint: we think it should be WordPress).</p>
<h3>Version Control Systems</h3>
<p><a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-version-control/">Version control systems</a> help you manage changes made to the code of your project. If you work on any kind of team, you’ll probably need to use a version control tool like Git or Apache Subversion. Familiarity with one of those systems is a requirement for some developer jobs.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons version control is essential. For one thing, you can use a version control system to revert to an earlier version of your code if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>That can save a lot of time in case of a mistake. Rather than hunting down the error and manually correcting it, you can simply roll back the project to an earlier version.</p>
<p>Version control systems are also critical whenever multiple users are working on the same project. They keep you from ending up with conflicting versions of the application.</p>
<p>Git is the most popular version control management system. You can familiarize yourself with Git by <a href="https://kinsta.com/help/git/">installing it on your computer</a> and creating an account on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub.com</a>.</p>
<h3>Problem-Solving Skills</h3>
<p>Technical skills are the first thing an employer looks for in a job candidate, but knowing code isn’t everything.</p>
<p>Backend developers have to be good problem solvers. They need to be flexible and capable of coming up with creative solutions to issues that arise.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a backend development job, you should be ready to talk to an interviewer about times you solved problems in your previous web development work.</p>
<h3>Communication Skills</h3>
<p>The stereotypical programmer spends their time working alone in front of a computer — and there’s no doubt that’s a big part of the job.</p>
<p>But communication is also an important aspect of most backend developer jobs. You’ll probably work on projects with a team of fellow developers. You may need to incorporate ideas from clients, product managers, or other stakeholders.</p>
<p>Be prepared to talk to an interviewer about times you successfully collaborated on a project or led a team.</p>
<h2>How to Become a Backend Developer</h2>
<p>For the most part, the key to <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-become-a-web-developer/">success as a web developer</a> isn’t having the right credentials but learning the right skills.</p>
<p>It’s possible to be a backend developer without formal training (although most have some). But you’ll need to be able to prove that you know how to code.</p>
<p>The first step to becoming a backend developer is making sure you have the skills listed above.</p>
<h3>Backend Development Training</h3>
<p>These days, there are a ton of online resources that can teach you how to code. For example, check out:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codecademy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coursera</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Khan Academy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn Python the Hard Way</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.udacity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Udacity</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Self-study is the norm now. <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#experience-learn-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">40.39%</a> of current professional web developers took an online coding course, 31.62% learned from online forums, and 59.53% used other online resources like blogs or videos.</p>
<p>That being said, most developers also have formal training. <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#education-ed-level-prof" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">80%</a> of professional developers have completed some form of higher education.</p>
<figure>
<p><figure style="width: 1011px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-84.png" alt="Where current developers learned to code according to StackOverflow" width="1011" height="489"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Where current developers learned to code. (<b>Source:</b> <a href="//insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#experience-learn-code%E2%80%9D">StackOverflow</a>)</figcaption></figure></p></figure>
<p>Many backend jobs require or prefer a relevant degree, but not all of them. If you’re entirely self-taught, you let your work speak for itself. Put a personal project or two on GitHub so potential employers can review your code.</p>
<h3>Finding Jobs for Backend Developers</h3>
<p><a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/linkedin-statistics/">LinkedIn</a> is a good place to start looking for web development jobs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.codingame.com/work/blog/hr-news-trends/tech-recruitment-2021-trends-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">78%</a> of developers say it’s their go-to place to look for job openings. It’s also the platform most used by recruiters.</p>
<figure>
<p><figure style="width: 931px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-88.png" alt="A chart showing where web developers find jobs according to CodeinGame" width="931" height="665"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Where web developers find jobs. (<b>Source:</b> <a href="//www.codingame.com/work/blog/hr-news-trends/tech-recruitment-2021-trends-statistics/%E2%80%9D">CodeinGame</a>)</figcaption></figure></p></figure>
<p>As major job search engines like Indeed and ZipRecruiter continue to grow, several niche job boards for web developers aren’t popular anymore, but <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/jobs?med=site-ui&ref=jobs-tab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StackOverflow</a> remains a good place to find quality development jobs.</p>
<p>Networking is always important. Hackathons and other tech events can connect you to your next backend developer job.</p>

<p>But did you know you can also register a domain that ends in <strong>.pizza</strong>?</p>
<p>Those letters at the tail end of a web address are called a domain extension, and there are around <a href="https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1,500</a> possibilities. Some are restricted to specific organizations or people, but anyone can quickly register most extensions.</p>
<p>That makes choosing the domain name for your website a bit complicated. Should you go with <strong>yourbusiness.bingo</strong> or <strong>yourbusiness.fish</strong>? If you sell fish, the latter may seem a better fit.</p>
<p>This article introduces domain extensions, including what they are, what they do, and how to choose the best one for your website.</p>
<div></div><kinsta-auto-toc heading="Table of Contents" exclude="last" list-style="arrow" selector="h2" count-number="-1"></kinsta-auto-toc>
<h2>What Is a Domain Extension?</h2>
<p>Domain extensions are the letters that follow the final period in a URL. Common extensions include <strong>.com</strong>, <strong>.org</strong>, and <strong>.net</strong>.</p>
<p>Another term for a domain extension is a <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-a-tld/">top-level domain</a>. That’s because you can think of the parts of a domain name as classification levels.</p>
<p>At the top, we have domain extensions. At this level, domains are divided into broad categories.</p>
<p>For example, the domain extension <strong>.de</strong> puts the domain in the “German” category. Using <strong>.gov</strong> means the domain is in the “American governmental organization” category.</p>
<p>Domain extensions aren’t always used this way anymore — we’ll get to that in a bit — but it was the original intention.</p>
<p>The next level down is the domain. That’s the part right before the extension. It designates which website the URL belongs to. In the URL <strong>kinsta.com</strong>, for example, “kinsta” is the domain.</p>
<p>Sometimes there’s another level called a <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-subdomain/">subdomain</a>. Subdomains organize a website into separate parts. For instance, the image below shows the URL <strong>blog.example.com</strong>.</p>
<p>Here, “blog” is the subdomain. The domain might also contain other subdomains like <strong>support.example.com</strong> or <strong>email.example.com</strong>.</p>
<figure>
<p><figure style="width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-49.png" alt="The different parts of a web page URL" width="900" height="880"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Parts of a web page URL. (<b>Source:</b> <a href="//ahrefs.com/blog/seo-friendly-urls/%E2%80%9D">Ahrefs</a>)</figcaption></figure></p></figure>
<p>When you <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/best-domain-registrar/">register a domain name</a>, you’ll have to choose both the name and a domain extension. Subdomains and anything in the URL that comes after the extension can be created later.</p>

<h2>Why Do Domain Extensions Exist?</h2>
<p>The original purpose of domain extensions was to classify websites by type.</p>
<p>For example, any website with an address ending in <strong>.com</strong> was supposed to be a commercial site.</p>
<p>But as you know, all sorts of websites use <strong>.com</strong>. As the internet has evolved, domain extensions have often been used differently than originally intended.</p>
<p>Here’s an example you might be less familiar with: the extension <strong>.fm</strong> is supposed to designate a website from Micronesia. But it’s currently used by many radio stations and audio streaming sites.</p>
<p>There are extensions, like <strong>.gov</strong>, that are restricted to specific organizations. But so many others are open to anyone.</p>
<p>As a website owner, your domain extension serves a few purposes. It can tell people what kind of site they’re on, it can inspire trust, and it can create a <a href="https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-a-url/">catchy and memorable URL</a>.</p>
<h2>Who’s in Charge of Domain Extensions?</h2>
<p>The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) manages domain extensions through its divisions, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).</p>
<p>An ICANN-designated registry operates each extension. The registry keeps a database of all domain names which use that extension.</p>
<p>For example, <strong>.com</strong>, <strong>.net</strong>, and various other extensions are managed by VeriSign, an American company. Branded extensions are usually managed by the company that registered them. For example, the <strong>.samsung</strong> registry is operated by Samsung.</p>
<p>Government branches or non-profits may operate country-code extensions. For instance, the registry operator for <strong>.in</strong> is the National Internet Exchange of India.</p>
<p>These registries contract the extension out to ICANN-accredited registrars. These are the companies where you can <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/best-domain-registrar/">register your domain name</a>, like Google Domains or Cloudflare.</p>

<h2>Types of Domain Extensions</h2>
<p>There are three types of domain extensions: generic TLDs, sponsored TLDs, and country-code TLDs.</p>
<h3>gTLDs</h3>
<p>The generic TLDs category includes the extensions we all know and love, like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>.com</strong></li>
<li><strong>.org</strong></li>
<li><strong>.net</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These were some of the first domain extensions, and they were labeled “generic” in contrast to country-code extensions.</p>
<p>In 2011, ICANN started allowing organizations to register their own generic domain extensions. That has led to branded extensions and a lot of other random extensions. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>.pharmacy</strong></li>
<li><strong>.baseball</strong></li>
<li><strong>.istanbul</strong></li>
<li><strong>.toyota</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>sTLDs</h3>
<p>Sponsored TLDs are extensions used by a specific entity. That could be a business, a branch of government, or another type of group. For example, some of the most common sTLDs are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>.gov</strong> (U.S. government)</li>
<li><strong>.edu</strong> (accredited U.S. post-secondary educational institutions)</li>
<li><strong>.mil</strong> (U.S. military)</li>
</ul>
<p>A few lesser-known sTLDs are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>.museum</strong> (museums)</li>
<li><strong>.cat</strong> (Catalan language websites)</li>
<li><strong>.jobs</strong> (websites with <a href="https://kinsta.com/careers/">job listings</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>ccTLDs</h3>
<p>Country code TLDs represent a specific country, like <strong>.jp</strong> for Japan. Each country-code domain extension has its own rules. Some are restricted to organizations in the country, while others are available to anyone.</p>
<p>Some common ccTLDs include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>.ru</strong> (Russia)</li>
<li><strong>.cn</strong> (China)</li>
<li><strong>.de</strong> (Germany)</li>
<li><strong>.ca</strong> (Canada)</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Are the Most Common Domain Extensions?</h2>
<p>While well over a thousand domain extensions are available, you’ll see some a lot more than others. Let’s look at a handful of the most famous ones.</p>
<h3>.com</h3>
<p>This is the one we all know best. Unsurprisingly, almost <a href="https://www.icdsoft.com/blog/what-are-the-most-popular-tlds-domain-extensions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">50%</a> of websites use the <strong>.com</strong> domain extension.</p>
<p>It may have once designated a commercial site, but today we can consider it the default domain extension.</p>
<h3>.net</h3>
<p>Like <strong>.com</strong>, <strong>.net</strong> is one of the earliest domain extensions. It was created for use by organizations involved in networking technologies.</p>
<p>These days, <strong>.net</strong> is often used as an alternative to <strong>.com</strong>. Companies that can’t get their preferred <strong>.com</strong> domain choose <strong>.net</strong>.</p>
<h3>.org</h3>
<p><strong>.org</strong> was created to be <a href="https://kinsta.com/web-hosting-for-nonprofits/">used by non-profits</a> and still is the domain extension of choice for those organizations.</p>
<p>The .org extension is open for anyone to use. However, if you choose a <strong>.org</strong> domain, most people won’t expect your site to be commercial.</p>
<h3>.edu</h3>
<p>In the early days of domain extensions, <strong>.edu</strong> could be used by any organization focused on education.</p>
<p>Since 2001, the extension has been restricted to post-secondary institutions accredited by an agency on a specific list. This means institutions do not often use it outside of the U.S.</p>
<h3>.gov</h3>
<p>The<strong> .gov</strong> extension can only be used by U.S. government organizations. It was initially only for federal government sites, but in 2003 was opened to state, local, and tribal governments.</p>
<p>A few branches of government don’t use <strong>.gov</strong>, like the United States Postal Service, which uses <strong>usps.com</strong>.</p>
<h3>.mil</h3>
<p><strong>.mil</strong> is restricted to the divisions, services, and agencies of the U.S. military. The U.S. is the only country with a domain extension for its military.</p>
<h3>.ru, .cn, .uk, etc.</h3>
<p>Many country codes are still commonly used for websites from those countries. You can probably assume that <a href="https://kinsta.com/wordpress-hosting-japan/">a .jp site</a>, for example, is really from Japan.</p>
<p>But a few country-code domain extensions have been co-opted for other purposes, including the next one on this list.</p>
<h3>.io</h3>
<p>If you know of any <strong>.io</strong> websites, they probably belong to tech companies. In recent years <strong>.io</strong> has risen in popularity with tech startups as it alludes to<strong> I/O</strong> (Input/Output), a popular tech jargon.</p>
<p>Businesses choose <strong>.io</strong> because it marks their website as related to technology. It’s also popular because <strong>.io</strong> domains are often available when the <strong>.com</strong> version is taken.</p>			<div class="in-post-container">

			</div>

<p>But IO also stands for the Indian Ocean. The domain extension’s original purpose was to designate websites from the British Indian Ocean Territory.</p>
<h3>.int</h3>
<p><strong>.int</strong> stands for international, and it’s one of the domain extensions with the strictest requirements. It can only be used by organizations and programs endorsed by an international treaty. For example, the European Space Agency website resides at <strong>esa.int</strong>.</p>
<p>However, some older <strong>.int</strong> domains that don’t meet the requirements, like <strong>ymca.int</strong>, have been retained.</p>
<h3>.mobi</h3>
<p>The <strong>.mobi</strong> TLD indicates that a site is <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/google-mobile-first-index/">optimized for mobile devices</a>. A site using <strong>.mobi</strong> has to comply with requirements set by the registry.</p>
<p>These days, almost all sites are mobile-friendly, so designating a separate <strong>.mobi</strong> site is less valuable than it once was.</p>
<h2>What Does the Domain Extension Mean for Your Website?</h2>
<p>You might be wondering if it matters which extension you choose for your website. What does a domain extension do for your site in practical terms?</p>
<p>First, it gives potential visitors their first impression of your website. Before they’ve even clicked the link and seen your design and content, people notice whether your site is a <strong>.com</strong>, <strong>.org</strong>, or <strong>.ninja</strong>, and each one will give them a different impression.</p>
<p>Second, some domain extensions are more expensive to register than others. For example, you’re likely to pay more for a <strong>.io</strong> domain name than one that ends in <strong>.com</strong>.</p>
<p>But your domain extension isn’t a choice you should make purely based on cost. Keep in mind that you might make more money with a trustworthy <strong>.com</strong> site than the same site registered with a <strong>.biz</strong> domain name.</p>
<p>Your domain extension doesn’t affect (at least not directly) search engine optimization.</p>
<p>Shortly after the new gTLDs were created, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldFPcJZulXQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google’s Matt Cutts</a> was asked how they would affect SEO.</p>
<p>He clarified that Google will always try to return the best result for the query, no matter what TLD the site uses.</p>
<p>However, your domain extension can affect your page rank indirectly.</p>
<p>Having a memorable and trustworthy domain name <a href="https://kinsta.com/ebooks/wordpress/how-to-improve-seo/">benefits your site’s SEO</a> because people are more likely to click and link to it.</p>
<h2>How to Choose the Best Domain Extension for Your Website</h2>
<p><a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/choose-domain-name/">Choosing a domain name</a> — including the extension — is a big decision.</p>
<p>After all, this is where your website will live from now on. Follow these best practices to pick the domain extension that will benefit your website the most.</p>
<h3>When in Doubt, Go Dot Com</h3>
<p>For most websites, the old reliable <strong>.com</strong> is the way to go. People recognize and trust <strong>.com</strong>. If they were going to guess your brand’s website, they would probably start with <strong>yourbrandname.com</strong>.</p>
<p>There are a few cases when it makes sense to use a different extension.</p>
<p>If your organization falls into a category that has a well-known designated domain extension, you can use that. For example, a non-profit should use <strong>.org</strong>, and an American university should use <strong>.edu</strong>.</p>
<p>Some businesses want to emphasize their location. If they’re in Canada, they might choose <strong>.ca</strong> (but <strong>.com</strong> is better if they operate globally).</p>			<div class="in-post-container">

</div>
			</div>

<p>While <strong>.com</strong> is the best domain extension for brands, your brand name is also critical.</p>
<p>So what do you do if <strong>yourbrandname.com</strong> is taken?</p>
<p>Choosing a different extension might make sense. In most cases, you should still go with something familiar to people, like <strong>.net</strong>.</p>
<h3>Make It Memorable</h3>
<p>If people follow a link to your website, the URL doesn’t matter that much.</p>
<p>But maybe they’ve been to your site before and want to revisit it. Or perhaps, they heard about the website from a friend.</p>
<p>In that case, they must remember your domain name.</p>
<p>When it comes to memorability, <strong>.com</strong> wins. Domains using .com are over <a href="https://growthbadger.com/top-level-domains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">33%</a> more memorable than URLs that use other top-level domains. When people forget a domain, they’re 3.8 times more likely to assume it ends in <strong>.com</strong> than anything else.</p>
<p>However, some of the new TLD extensions allow businesses to create memorable, more creative domains. For example, if your business is Pasta Guru, you could now register <strong>pasta.guru</strong> (someone has registered that domain already).</p>

(<b>Source:</b> <a href="//growthbadger.com/top-level-domains/%E2%80%9D">GrowthBadger</a>)</figcaption></figure></p></figure>
<h3>Make Your Site’s Purpose Clear</h3>
<p>Domain extensions were initially intended to classify sites by their purpose or type.</p>
<p>While things are more flexible these days, your domain name still gives visitors a clue about what your site is about.</p>
<p>The default is <strong>.com</strong> — it can be used for almost anything. But if you choose a different extension, make sure it will give visitors the correct impression of what your website is all about.</p>
<h3>Avoid Suspicious Sounding Domains</h3>
<p>Are you more likely to give your credit card information to <strong>buywidgets.com</strong> or <strong>buywidgets.zip</strong>?</p>
<p>If you chose the first one, you’re not alone.</p>
<p>People tend to be wary of specific domain extensions, often with good reason. There are extensions that spammy sites have almost entirely taken over.</p>
<p>So how do you avoid a sketchy-sounding domain name?</p>
<p>Unless you qualify for something like <strong>.gov</strong> or <strong>.mil</strong>, your best bet is to stick with (you guessed it) <strong>.com</strong>.</p>

<h2>Can You Invent Your Own Domain Extension?</h2>
<p>With all these crazy words at the end of URLs, could you make up your own?</p>
<p>Technically, the answer is yes. You can apply to register a brand new generic domain extension (gTLD). Though, for most individuals and small business owners, it’s not a realistic option.</p>
<p>First of all, you can’t just apply at any time — you have to wait for ICANN to open for applications. No one knows when that will happen next, but many people are guessing 2022.</p>
<p>Maybe you’re willing to wait that long. Next, you’ll need to pay an application fee. During the last registration period, that fee was <a href="https://newgtlds.icann.org/en/applicants/global-support/faqs/faqs-en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$185,000</a>.</p>
<p>If that’s a worthy investment to secure your brand’s unique domain extension, you can start filling out the application. ICANN has a list of requirements your domain extension will have to meet. For example, it can’t be “confusingly similar” to another TLD.</p>
<p>You’ll also need the technical capacity to act as a registry for all the sites that use this extension.</p>
<p>In other words, <strong>yourbrandname.com</strong> will work just fine for your website.</p>
<h2>How to Register a Domain Extension</h2>
<p>You can choose your domain extension when you register your domain name.</p>
<p>Not every domain extension is available from every domain registrar. However, major registrars like <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/google-domains-review/">Google Domains</a>, GoDaddy, and Namecheap will have many TLDs, including the most common ones.</p>
<p>Some extensions will probably be <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/how-much-does-a-domain-name-cost/">more expensive than others</a>. If you’ve chosen a domain name and extension that you know is available, you can shop around at a few registrars to see who offers the best price.</p>
<figure>
<p><figure style="width: 1501px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-83.png" alt="A list of domain extension options at NameCheap" width="1501" height="787"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Domain extension options at NameCheap.</figcaption></figure></p></figure>
<p>A few less common domain extensions will only be offered at niche registrars.</p>
<p>If you can’t find a place to register your extension of choice, you can try to figure out who’s in charge of it. To do that, visit <a href="https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this list of TLDs</a>. Click on the extension you want and scroll down to “Registry Information.”</p>
<p>You should see a link to the organization that registered the extension. In some cases, it will be a domain name registrar that you can use.</p>
<p>The gTLD might also belong to a brand or organization that plans to keep the extension to itself.</p>
<h2>Can a Domain Extension Be Changed?</h2>
<p>Wish you had chosen a different domain extension for your website?</p>
<p>You can change it by <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-redirect/">setting up a 301 redirect</a>. 301 redirects let search engines know that the page you want to send visitors has moved.</p>
<p>First, you’ll need to register your new domain name and create a clone of your site using the updated extension. Then you’ll redirect all of your URLs to the latest version.</p>
<p><a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-change-domain/">Here’s a handy tutorial</a> on redirecting your WordPress site to a new domain.</p>
<p>Changing your domain name can temporarily affect SEO. But if you do them right, your rankings should be back to normal quickly.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>It may just be a few short letters at the end of your domain name, but your domain extension is an essential part of your website.</p>
<p>It can make the website URL seem trustworthy and memorable — or it can do the opposite. It can make a difference in how much your website costs to create and maintain. And it can give visitors information about your website.</p>
<p>The use of domain extensions has changed with time, and it will continue to change.</p>
<p>In the future, the new TLDs might overtake the old standards. <strong>.io</strong> might be the extension for every tech company. But today, a tried-and-true TLD like <strong>.com</strong> or <strong>.org</strong> is still your best choice.</p>
