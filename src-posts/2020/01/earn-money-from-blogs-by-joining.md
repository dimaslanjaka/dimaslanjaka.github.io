blogs.</span> <span class="notranslate"> And now more and more are trying to become bloggers with the main goal of making money on the internet.</span> </p><noscript><img alt="Dapatkan Penghasilan Dengan Bergabung Di Influencer Marketing" height="720" src="https://imgcdn.000webhostapp.com/https/1.bp.blogspot.com/03da055f127dafc6ced3d4779f95687e.jpeg" title="Earn money by joining Influencer Marketing" width="1280"></noscript><p> <span class="notranslate"> And more and more are also making bloggers as the main occupation or the term as a full time blogger even though bloggers are not / not yet included in the type of work recognized especially in Indonesia.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> Various reasons that become full time bloggers, one of the reasons is to become a blogger is not limited by work time, do not need enough work uniforms with a collector, and many other reasons.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> Therefore, now more and more bloggers are popping up who are tempted to easily get money from the internet without being limited by work time or office attendance and do not need to be uniform and will not be scolded by employers.</span> </p><img src="https://imgcdn.000webhostapp.com/https/1.bp.blogspot.com/b8dd27464c66dab73401cf299fb84a9c.webp" title="Join Influencer Marketing" width="100%" height="auto"><p> <span class="notranslate"> But of course it's not as easy as turning your palm to get money from a blog, but it takes effort and hard work to work as a blogger.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Not as easy as the previous article you read about the easy way to get money on the internet.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Because it is not easy to make money through blogs, it requires determination to never give up and work tirelessly.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> What must be known is that when we become a blogger by creating a blog, then we will not immediately get money.</span> <span class="notranslate"> But we must build a blog first so that the blogs we manage can make money.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> In building a blog it takes a lot of effort and can spend a lot of time and be patient.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> It is true that writing is the work of bloggers, but not just writing just like that but it also requires techniques so that the writing we make can be found by many people.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> Until now, Adsense is still the main target of bloggers to get money from blogs.</span> <span class="notranslate"> But you should also know that when a blog is accepted as an Adsense publisher, then we don't necessarily get money just like that.</span> <span class="notranslate"> But we must be diligent in writing useful and widely found by many people.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> And Adsense is not the only way to get money from blogs, but many other things that can make blogs as a money-making machine.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> One of them is a job review or rather can be said as selling backlinks.</span> <span class="notranslate"> There are 2 ways to sell blog backlinks, namely direct offers on blogs and offers through marketplate influencers.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> Simply backlink is a link that is planted on a website and directed to other websites.</span> <span class="notranslate"> And buying and selling backlinks is related to the optimization of a website to increase the level of a website on search engines and also to increase website popularity.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> The conditions for selling backlinks that are generally seen by backlink buyers are Alexa ranking, DA (Domain Authority), PA (Page Authority), and Google's index.</span> <span class="notranslate"> The smaller Alexa ranking and the greater the value of DA, PA, and Google index will increasingly affect the price of a review job or the sale price of a backlink.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> We as bloggers can offer our blog for job reviews or sell backlinks by creating a job review offer page.</span> <span class="notranslate"> For job reviews, there are usually 2 ways: review content written by the owner of the blog itself or content provided by backlink buyers.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Usually the price for review content written by blog owners is higher than the content provided by backlink buyers.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> Or we can offer our blog for job reviews or selling backlinks through an influencer marketplate that brings together buyers and advertisers and backlink publishers.</span> <span class="notranslate"> And here are some marketplace influencers who can try to sell your blog's backlink.</span> </p><ol><li> <span class="notranslate"> <a href="https://dimaslanjaka.github.io/page/safelink.html?url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc29zaWFnby5pZC8=" rel="nofollow

</li></ol><p> <span class="notranslate"> The list of influencer marketing above will continue to be updated, and please provide a list of influencer marketplaces that you are participating in if not already listed above, please include in the comments column.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> The system and the way each influencer marketing works, of course, varies with the amount of commission received.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> But clearly everything is influenced by Alexa ranking, DA (Domain Authority), PA (Page Authority), and Google's index.</span> <span class="notranslate"> And the process can be with content from advertisers or content written by the publisher.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> Remember, the smaller the Alexa ranking and the greater the value of DA, PA, and Google's index, the higher the selling price of your blog's backlink.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> So please create and manage your blogs as best you can, the more blogs, the greater our chances of getting money from blogs.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> And until now part of my income from the internet is from job reviews or content placement or content replacement from several blogs that I manage.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> Hopefully useful.</span> </p><div class="clear"></div></div><br><div
