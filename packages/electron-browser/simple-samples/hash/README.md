# Hash

Simple [Electron](http://electron.atom.io) application that shows the hash
values of entered text using different algorithms.

## Getting started

- Install [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org)
- Clone this repository
- `cd hash`
- `npm install` to install the application's dependencies
- `npm start` to start the application

## Going further

Here are some ideas on how it can be improved using other Electron APIs.

- Make headings links that open to Wikipedia page for algorithm.
- Support dragging/dropping a file to hash onto the window.
- Support opening a file via a dialog to hash from the app's menu.
- Display time taken to compute each hash.
