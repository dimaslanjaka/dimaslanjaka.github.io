<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">  You having problems with gmail smtp server. Like this <kbd> Gmail SMTP error please log in via your web browser , Then Goggle says: Please log in via your web browser and then try again. 534-5.7.14 Learn more at https://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?answer=787</kbd> ?.<br>  I know this is an older issue, but I recently had the same problem and was   having issues resolving it, despite attempting the DisplayUnlockCaptcha   fix. This is how I got it alive.   <br>  Firstly you must activate less secure apps at <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/security?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow">https://myaccount.google.com/security?hl=en</a>  <figure>    <img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-axfbmdLI3Pc/XoIVHlkeicI/AAAAAAAAAA0/N9WMnayMq20kxlOxwl3vZgydjoGi9AcxQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/imgingest-2117968900021071073.png" alt="enable less secure apps" style="width:100%">    <figcaption>Enable less secure apps</figcaption>  </figure>  <br>  Head over to Account Security Settings (   <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow">    https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps   </a>  ) and enable "Access for less secure apps", this allows you to use the   google smtp for clients other than the official ones.   <br>  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">    <figure>      <img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-atdwl-jQEh0/XoIWlT0DoaI/AAAAAAAAABA/cWA2QM8H9Ds6BQ6tQyvpFxlnXJef4DiegCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/imgingest-2117968900021071073.png" alt="enable less secure apps" style="width:100%">      <figcaption>Enable less secure apps</figcaption>    </figure>  </div>  <br>  <strong>Update</strong>  <br>  Google has been so kind as to   <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/14257" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow">    list   </a>  all the potential problems and fixes for us. Although I recommend trying   the   <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow">    less secure apps setting   </a>  . Be sure you are applying these to the correct account.   <br>  <blockquote>    <ul>      <li>        If you've turned on 2-Step Verification for your account, you might         need to enter an         <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185834?hl=en#ASPs" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow">          App password         </a>        instead of your regular password.       </li>      <li>        Sign in to your account from the web version of Gmail at         <a href="https://mail.google.com/" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow">          https://mail.google.com         </a>        . Once you’re signed in, try signing in         <br>        to the mail app again.       </li>      <li>        Visit         <a href="http://www.google.com/accounts/DisplayUnlockCaptcha" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow">          http://www.google.com/accounts/DisplayUnlockCaptcha         </a>        and sign in with your Gmail username and password. If asked, enter         the         <br>        letters in the distorted picture.       </li>      <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">        <figure>          <img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1u9KfUFTz54/XoITM22-RQI/AAAAAAAAAAc/PbH8qXLj9OwKKt6WJL-FMwWOziMj99dFgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screenshot_4.png" alt="enable less secure apps" style="width:100%">          <figcaption>Continue</figcaption>        </figure>        <figure>          <img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O_sDQWQHPBM/XoITc7xrDoI/AAAAAAAAAAo/Dp-l6clwgVEiJMSgudXvtv2lJiKSQ1gHQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/imgingest-2117968900021071073.png" alt="enable less secure apps" style="width:100%">          <figcaption>Success, now run your smtp again</figcaption>        </figure>      </div>      <li>        Your app might not support the latest security standards. Try         changing a few settings to         <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow">          allow less secure apps         </a>        access to your account.       </li>      <li>        Make sure your mail app isn't set to check for new email too often.         If your mail app checks for new messages more than once every 10         <br>        minutes, the app’s access to your account could be blocked.       </li>    </ul>  </blockquote>  <div>    Did you success with it ?.<br>    let's put your comments below.
