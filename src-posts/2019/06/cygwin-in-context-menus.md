<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><blockquote>How might I make a Cygwin alternate way that will open Cygwin at a particular envelope? This would hinder composing <pre>cd disc/cygdrive/c/Users/Tom/Desktop/ </pre>each time I dispatch Cygwin. </blockquote><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dimaslanjaka/image/fetch/https://image3.mouthshut.com/images/imagesp/925039881s.png"><p>When you introduce Cygwin (or in the event that you've just introduced it, download it   again and begin setup again to run an update), ensure that you select   the <code>chere</code> bundle under the "Shells" classification. </p><p>    After Cygwin is launched, open Cygwin terminal and type command: </p><pre>chere -i -t mintty -s bash</pre><p></p><p>    Presently you bought to have "Bash Prompt Here" in the Windows right-click setting   menu. </p><p>    (<a href="https://code.google.com/p/mintty/" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow">mintty</a> is     Cygwin's default terminal. If you don't choose it with the <code>-t</code>    option, your "Bash Prompt Here" will use the same terminal as the Windows     Command Prompt, which prevents horizontal resizing.) </p> </div>
