     }      .td_uid_21_5de4edaacbee5_rand.td-a-rec-img img {                      margin: 0 auto 0 0;                  } </style></div><p> <span class="notranslate"> When static content is loaded from the web <b>(js, images, css, videos, and various other types of content)</b> users will immediately receive content from the closest location to the CDN, not through the web server.</span> <span class="notranslate"> In this case lies the superiority of Cloudflare, because your website as a user can load faster by end users wherever they are.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> Indeed, CDN is not actually given away for free / free, but Cloudflare is willing to provide you with a free CDN with other additional features.</span> <span class="notranslate"> This CDN is able to save Cloudflare bandwidth and spread it to all static content on the web, only afterwards to spread it back to the entire CloudFlare data center.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> Cloudflare claims that there are more than 20 CloudFlare data centers scattered, especially in Southeast Asia, located in Singapore.</span> <span class="notranslate"> CDN is very popular with developers because it can save bandwidth up to 50% in size.</span> <span class="notranslate"> So, websites can be 2x faster.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Although your website might already use the W3 Total Cache plugin, it still won't be faster than websites that use this Cloudflare CDN.</span> </p><h2> <span class="notranslate"> Featured in CloudFlare</span> </h2><p> <span class="notranslate"> <b>Mirroring</b> : The content that is on your site will become a mirror to each Cloudflare data center.</span> <span class="notranslate"> This is why your website as a user can be optimized faster when visitors are far from the main server.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> <b>Caching</b> : This means that Cloudflare runs the caching function at certain times and conditions.</span> <span class="notranslate"> This one feature will save your hosting bandwidth, especially if your hosting has a limit on bandwidth.</span> <span class="notranslate"> So, simply put your connection will go both ways, namely to the web visitor and to the server.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> <b>Firewall</b> : This one feature can protect your website from security threats.</span> <span class="notranslate"> In addition, you can block IPs from other countries, so you can determine which visitors can visit your website.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> <b>Analytics</b> : This feature means monitoring of all activities that occur on your website.</span> <span class="notranslate"> What are the activities that are monitored? For example the number of requests sent during the last 24 hours, the number of unique visitors, the origin of the visitor, and also the bandwidth that is available for 24 hours straight.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> <b>Railgun</b> : This feature can also affect the speed of your website.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Even Cloudflare with this feature claims that your website can increase its speed up to 300%.</span> <span class="notranslate"> However, this feature can only be used by paid version users or if your hosting provider has a partnership with Cloudflare.</span> </p><h2> <span class="notranslate"> What are the benefits of Cloudflare?</span> </h2><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"> <span class="notranslate"> Cloudflare can hide the real IP address of your web hosting.</span> <span class="notranslate"> What are the implications?</span> <span class="notranslate"> Hackers become difficult and can not attack the server that is run.</span> </li><li style="font-weight: 400;"> <span class="notranslate"> Cloudflare also creates a web cache so that resources to load the site can be faster and the server load is reduced.</span> </li><li style="font-weight: 400;"> <span class="notranslate"> Cloudflare also provides optimal protection against all DDoS attacks by changing aspects of your web security.</span> </li><li style="font-weight: 400;"> <span class="notranslate"> If your site is down again, CloudFlare claims to be committed to continuing to serve cached data until the site can be up again.</span> </li><li style="font-weight: 400;"> <span class="notranslate"> If the registrar doesn't give you the choice to add DNS records, we can use nameservers from Cloudflare and add host DNS records there.</span> </li><li style="font-weight: 400;"> <span class="notranslate"> CloudFlare also offers a free service if we want to add multiple domains at once.</span> </li><li style="font-weight: 400;"> <span class="notranslate"> We can block site access from certain regions / countries.</span> <span class="notranslate"> This setting can be desired by users if at any time they get a lot of attacks from certain countries.</span> </li></ul><p> <span class="notranslate"> Finally, Cloudflare wants to give SSL free to its users, which can also be used on shared hosts.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Know the <a href="https://web-manajemen.blogspot.com/p/search.html?q=blog%20manfaat%20ssl%20untuk%20seo%20dan%20keamanan%20data%20pengguna" target="_blank" rel="follow" alt="Panduan Dasar Cloudflare">importance of the SSL Certificate</a> .</span> </p><h2> <span class="notranslate"> How to Open an Account on Cloudflare and Add a Website</span> </h2><p> <span class="notranslate"> 1.

Create a Cloudflare account by typing in your email address and password.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Click "Create account now" to proceed to the next step.</span> <span class="notranslate"> We recommend using an official email from your company.</span> <span class="notranslate"> For example, <a href="" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="f59b9498949a87949b92b59b9498948590878086949d94949bdb969a98db" alt="Panduan Dasar Cloudflare">webmanagement@gmail.com</a> Why?</span> <span class="notranslate"> Because billing email notifications and any info related to the service will be sent to this email address.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> 3. Enter the domain for your website then click "Add site".</span> <span class="notranslate"> You don't need to add "www" to the domain.</span> <span class="notranslate"> For example, if your website is www.name.com, just type nama.com.</span> </p><p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19136" src="https://imgcdn.000webhostapp.com/https/dwblog-ecdf.kxcdn.com/c76b5d7f042296c6fa5fd7528166e8c0.png" alt="Add Site Cloudflare 2 - Dewaweb" width="100%" height="auto" srcset="https://imgcdn.000webhostapp.com/https/dwblog-ecdf.kxcdn.com/d2d9cc63e560565424629507c94afe9a.png 838w, https://imgcdn.000webhostapp.com/https/dwblog-ecdf.kxcdn.com/8cb34d302f80cc5669b838738f35aab4.png 300w, https://imgcdn.000webhostapp.com/https/dwblog-ecdf.kxcdn.com/7196a5cfbcdb9be5351abdce28a93ecb.png 768w, https://imgcdn.000webhostapp.com/https/dwblog-ecdf.kxcdn.com/b576e627856e238c18c1352775c9c157.png 696w, https://imgcdn.000webhostapp.com/https/dwblog-ecdf.kxcdn.com/c76b5d7f042296c6fa5fd7528166e8c0.png 762w" title="Cloudflare Basic Guide | Dewaweb Blog"> <span class="notranslate"> 4. Cloudflare will later scan DNS records from your domain.</span> <span class="notranslate"> This will take about 60 seconds to complete.</span> <span class="notranslate"> After the DNS scan is complete, click "Next".</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> 5. Choose the package that suits your needs, then click "Confirm Plan".</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> 6. A list of all the DNS records that have been found will be displayed, including your subdomain.</span> <span class="notranslate"> In this step, you can decide which subdomains you want to activate with Cloudflare.</span> <span class="notranslate"> If there are additional notes that you want to add to Cloudflare, you can add them here.</span> <span class="notranslate"> After you have reviewed your DNS records, click "Next".</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> 7. In the final step, you will be given a Cloudflare name server for your domain.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Cloudflare nameservers are assigned to your domain and are listed on this page.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> 8. Click Continue.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Now, you must now proceed to the Crypto tab of your new Cloudflare account to verify that Universal SSL Cloudflare records have been set for your domain.</span> <span class="notranslate"> These should appear as two records in the Edge Certificates section: One for your root domain <b>(example.com)</b> and one for the wildcard subdomain <b>(* .example.com)</b> .</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> Note: Wait up to 72 hours to be able to spread server name information.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Later, you will receive a confirmation email from Cloudflare when the name server update is complete.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Your website will not experience downtime during this period.</span> </p><h3> <span class="notranslate"> Conclusion</span> </h3><p> <span class="notranslate"> Well, how, do you now understand the basics of Cloudflare?</span> <span class="notranslate"> As a cheap and cheap vps hosting provider, especially Indonesian cloud hosting that <a href="https://web-manajemen.blogspot.com/p/search.html?q=blog%20cloud%20hosting%20pertama%20di%20indonesia%20dengan%20sertifikat%20iso%2027001" target="_blank" rel="follow" alt="Panduan Dasar Cloudflare">has been internationally certified</a> , we are committed to your success online.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Also read other interesting articles from us on our blog and subscribe to get the latest updates from our blog or free ebook.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Congratulations on developing your business, good luck!</span> </p><center><br></center><br><center> <span class="notranslate"> <small>Cloudflare Basic Guide |</small></span> <span class="notranslate"> <small>Dewaweb Blog</small></span> </center></div></div>  <script src="https://codepen.io/dimaslanjaka/pen/aQRrbR.js"></script>
