Technically, RankBrain is an algorithm, but this type of algorithm will continue to change and evolve because it has an <i>artificial</i> <i>intelligence</i> (AI) function.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> Based on statements made by Google via Twitter in March 2019, RankBrain is an AI-based system created to understand how search results relate to certain concepts.</span> <span class="notranslate"> So, even if you don't use the right keywords, Google can estimate what you really need.</span> <span class="notranslate"> For example, when you search for <b>"why does my TV look strange," the</b> results that appear on the main page are about <b>"soap opera effect,"</b> because even though they don't have the exact same keywords, they both have the same concept, which is clumsiness display on television caused by the effects of soap operas.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> Through an interview with Bloomberg, Google stated that <a href="https://dimaslanjaka.github.io/page/safelink.html?url=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTUtMTAtMjYvZ29vZ2xlLXR1cm5pbmctaXRzLWx1Y3JhdGl2ZS13ZWItc2VhcmNoLW92ZXItdG8tYWktbWFjaGluZXM=" target="_blank" rel="follow" alt="Panduan Lengkap Seo Update 2020">RankBrain</a> is the third most important factor influencing search results on the Google search engine.</span> <span class="notranslate"> How not, RankBrain can help Google match keywords to the concept in question and match with AI technology also helps Google to do searches that are increasingly similar to what is searched for.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> RankBrain focuses on the following two important things:</span> </p><ol><li> <span class="notranslate"> How long a visitor spends time in your yard.</span> </li><li> <span class="notranslate"> What percentage of users clicked <i>on your</i> <i>website</i> <i>link</i> on the search results page.</span> </li></ol><p> <span class="notranslate"> From the two things above, we will discuss them one by one so that you understand what type of optimization can be applied when studying the complete SEO guidelines below.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> The first aspect of time is called Dwell Time or the amount of time users spend on your <i>website</i> .</span> <span class="notranslate"> Based on studies published by <strong><a href="https://dimaslanjaka.github.io/page/safelink.html?url=aHR0cHM6Ly9zZWFyY2hlbmdpbmVsYW5kLmNvbS9zZWFyY2htZXRyaWNzLWdvb2dsZS1yYW5raW5nLWZhY3RvcnMtc3R1ZHktc2F5cy1jb250ZW50LWdhaW5pbmctbGlua3MtbG9zaW5nLWltcG9ydGFuY2UtMjY1NDMx" target="_blank" rel="follow" alt="Panduan Lengkap Seo Update 2020">Search Engine Land</a></strong> , a good average Dwell Time to get into the top 10 of Google's search results is <b>3 minutes 10 seconds</b> .</span> <span class="notranslate"> If you don't believe it, try reviewing it from <a href="https://dimaslanjaka.github.io/page/safelink.html?url=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmFseXRpY3MuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8=" target="_blank" rel="follow" alt="Panduan Lengkap Seo Update 2020"><strong>Google Analytics</strong></a> .</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> In fact, Dwell Time makes perfect sense as a ranking factor for <i>websites.</i></span> <span class="notranslate"> The reason is, if an internet user spends a considerable amount of time on a particular page on your <i>website</i> , then that user likes the content he is reading.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Now, the more people who do the same on your <em>website</em> , Google will increase the page rank so that it can be more easily searched by other users.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> So how do you make visitors feel at home on your <i>website</i> ?</span> <span class="notranslate"> The first thing of course is to <b>make sure your</b> <i><b>website</b></i> <b>page</b> <b>can be displayed quickly.</b></span> <span class="notranslate"> If not, <i>website</i> visitors will immediately exit the page.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Actually, if you use <a href="https://web-manajemen.blogspot.com/p/search.html?q=hosting%20murah" target="_blank" rel="follow" alt="Panduan Lengkap Seo Update 2020"><strong>cheap</strong></a> but good <a href="https://web-manajemen.blogspot.com/p/search.html?q=hosting%20murah" target="_blank" rel="follow" alt="Panduan Lengkap Seo Update 2020"><strong>hosting</strong></a> , you can guarantee the speed of <i>loading</i> <i>pages</i> on your <i>website</i> .</span> <span class="notranslate"> In addition, if your <i>website</i> receives a lot of visits, you can avoid slowing the <i>loading</i> <i>page.</i></span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> Another thing to consider is content.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Of course you need to make interesting and quality content.</span> <span class="notranslate"> This will be discussed in the next section in this complete SEO guide.</span> <span class="notranslate"> But beforehand, consider the discussion about the second aspect of RankBrain, namely <i>click-through-rate</i> !</span> </p><h2 class="western"> <span class="notranslate"> <b>Click-Through-Rate (CTR)</b></span> </h2><p> <span class="notranslate"> As mentioned earlier in the second aspect of RankBrain, CTR relates to the percentage of users who click your <i>website</i> <i>link</i> in search results.</span> <span class="notranslate"> You also need to pay attention to your CTR, not only because of RankBrain, but also because of the emergence of types of search results in addition to the regular page <i>links</i> that contain your <i>website</i> pages.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> We tried searching for the keyword <b>"cheap clothes"</b> on the Google search engine.</span> <span class="notranslate"> The results are three types of search results, respectively:</span> </p><p><img src="https://imgcdn.000webhostapp.com/https/dwblog-ecdf.kxcdn.com/74fd48af6d5af1ba2fe7f435de277694.png" alt="Result-Page-Sponsored-Google" width="auto" height="auto" name="graphics1" border="0" max-width="100%" title="Complete Guide to Update Seo 2020"></p><p> <span class="notranslate"> The search results column sponsored by Google.</span> </p><p><img src="https://imgcdn.000webhostapp.com/https/dwblog-ecdf.kxcdn.com/36af862b795016c8fd8abbb09e47fd0c.png" alt="Result Page Ad Google" width="auto" height="auto" name="graphics2" border="0" max-width="100%" title="Complete Guide to Update Seo 2020"></p><p> <span class="notranslate"> The search results column, paid advertising or AdWords.</span> </p><p><img src="https://imgcdn.000webhostapp.com/https/dwblog-ecdf.kxcdn.com/1beaf165c2faae88e230d3762c0e157e.png" alt="Result-Page-Location-Google" width="auto" height="auto" name="graphics3" border="0" max-width="100%" title="Complete Guide to Update Seo 2020"></p><p> <span class="notranslate"> Third, search results are based on location like in the picture above.</span> <span class="notranslate"> The Answer Boxes column, advertisements, <i>carousels</i> , and "People also ask" will be more interesting for search engine users to click on, unless you are trying to increase the chances of CTR.</span> <span class="notranslate"> How to?</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> First, change the title of the content to make it more interesting to click by <b>including numbers</b> .</span> <span class="notranslate"> Because, humans like something concise, especially if you have to read something online, it will be more efficient if you make an article in the form of a list or " <i>listicle.</i></span> <span class="notranslate"> "Various studies have proven that titles containing <i>lists</i> can increase the percentage of CTR.</span> <span class="notranslate"> In addition, try to make the <b>upload link descriptive in accordance with the title of the</b> content created.</span> <span class="notranslate"> You can see an example of the following Dewaweb articles.</span> </p><p><img src="https://imgcdn.000webhostapp.com/https/dwblog-ecdf.kxcdn.com/594f14eb8e6e84577478966a6a9f2570.png" width="auto" height="auto" name="graphics4" border="0" max-width="100%" title="Complete Guide to Update Seo 2020"></p><p> <span class="notranslate"> Also use <b>words that are</b> <i><b>"emotional</b></i></span> <b> </b> <span class="notranslate"> <i><b>hook "</b></i> or that can provoke the reader emotions by using adjectives.</span> <span class="notranslate"> What are some examples?</span> <span class="notranslate"> Words like "telling", "success", and so on.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Even though this method seems ridiculous, the nature of the market does show more interest in these types.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> Finally, there are ways you can do this SEO guidelines so that Google makes your content a <i>featured post</i> so that your page enters the Featured Snippet that appears in a special column and is at the top of Google.</span> <span class="notranslate"> We made a specific guide before in the article titled <a href="https://web-manajemen.blogspot.com/p/search.html?q=blog%20tips%20seo%20google%20serp%20snippet" target="_blank" rel="follow" alt="Panduan Lengkap Seo Update 2020"><strong>Google SERP Snippet SEO Tips</strong></a> .</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> Next, let's discuss a complete SEO guide through the following topics.</span> </p> <a

max-width="100%" title="Complete Guide to Update Seo 2020"></a> <h2> <span class="notranslate"> <strong>Complete SEO Guide</strong></span> </h2><h3 class="western"> <span class="notranslate"> <b>Mobile-first Index from Google</b></span> </h3><p> <span class="notranslate"> In November 2016, <a href="https://dimaslanjaka.github.io/page/safelink.html?url=aHR0cHM6Ly93ZWJtYXN0ZXJzLmdvb2dsZWJsb2cuY29tLzIwMTYvMTEvbW9iaWxlLWZpcnN0LWluZGV4aW5nLmh0bWw=" target="_blank" rel="follow" alt="Panduan Lengkap Seo Update 2020"><strong>Google announced</strong></a> that it was shifting focus to <i>mobile</i> users with a " <i>mobile-first</i> <i>index</i> ." This means that Google will consider the look of your <em>website</em> if accessed mobile.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> Since most of the searches made come from smart devices, this one Google step makes sense.</span> <span class="notranslate"> The number of smart devices using search is indeed increasing, along with the increasing number of mobile devices themselves.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> This is why you have to set up your <i>website to</i> be <i>mobile</i> friendly <i>.</i></span> <span class="notranslate"> There are some simple steps you can take to prepare it.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> <b>First</b> , make your content look consistent, both on <i>desktop</i> and <i>mobile</i> devices <i>.</i></span> <span class="notranslate"> Sometimes, people hide some of their content in the <i>mobile</i> version <i>.</i></span> <span class="notranslate"> They provide a "More" or "Click to read more." Button For Google, this will be a problem.</span> <span class="notranslate"> It's better if you display 100% of your content in both versions, both on <i>desktop</i> and <i>mobile.</i></span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> <b>Second</b> , migrate your m-dot domain (a mobile version of a website, such as "m.facebook") into a website with a more responsive design.</span> <span class="notranslate"> The reason, now Google already has the first <i>desktop</i> index.</span> <span class="notranslate"> If not, Google doesn't really index your <i>website</i> 's m-dot.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> <b>Third</b> , make sure your <i>website</i> is <i>mobile-friendly,</i> in the sense that it can work well on <i>smartphones</i> and <i>tablets.</i></span> <span class="notranslate"> Your website display also needs to be maximally displayed, according to the screen size of the <i>mobile</i> device used.</span> <span class="notranslate"> As was discussed at the beginning of the RankBrain issue, Google will really measure the interactions that occur between users and your <i>website</i> .</span> <span class="notranslate"> What if the look of your <i>website is</i> too heavy for <i>mobile</i> devices and users can't wait and then exit the page?</span> <span class="notranslate"> To test whether your <i>website</i> is <i>mobile-friendly</i> or not, use a <a href="https://dimaslanjaka.github.io/page/safelink.html?url=aHR0cHM6Ly9zZWFyY2guZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS90ZXN0L21vYmlsZS1mcmllbmRseQ==" target="_blank" rel="follow" alt="Panduan Lengkap Seo Update 2020">testing tool from Google</a> .</span> </p><p><img src="https://imgcdn.000webhostapp.com/https/dwblog-ecdf.kxcdn.com/557d8ae0bc64c3ccb6c25997e520a76d.png" alt="Google Mobile Friendly Test" width="auto" height="auto" name="graphics5" border="0" max-width="100%" title="Complete Guide to Update Seo 2020"></p><p> <span class="notranslate"> Enter your domain name and click <b>"Run Test."</b> The results will be displayed as shown below:</span> </p><p><img src="https://imgcdn.000webhostapp.com/https/dwblog-ecdf.kxcdn.com/993bf266c9ce190c9f29ad714e7c17d6.png" alt="Google Mobile Friendly Test Result" width="auto" height="auto" name="graphics6" border="0" max-width="100%" title="Complete Guide to Update Seo 2020"></p><p> <span class="notranslate"> If there is a problem on your <i>website</i> , a testing tool from Google will also tell you what the problem is and how the solution is recommended.</span> <span class="notranslate"> After that, you can immediately detect which pages or sections the problem is happening and you can fix it immediately.</span> </p><h3 class="western"> <span class="notranslate"> <b>Comprehensive Content</b></span> </h3><p> <span class="notranslate"> If in the past Google focused more on the accuracy of the keywords you use through keywords entered in the search field, Google is now smarter with the development of existing algorithms.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Google will continue to consider keywords in the title tag, URL, ALT text image, Description Tag and H1 and H2 Tags (for more information, read the <a href="https://web-manajemen.blogspot.com/p/search.html?q=blog%20keyword%20research" target="_blank" rel="follow" alt="Panduan Lengkap Seo Update 2020"><strong>Keyword Research Guide</strong></a> ).</span> <span class="notranslate"> However, the quality of the discussion on your content will be the main thing to determine whether Google will be indexed and displayed on the search results page.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> Now, the next problem in understanding the complete SEO guidelines is how you can create <i>in-depth</i> content or commonly called <i>"in-depth"?</i></span> <span class="notranslate"> There are several things to consider, like the <b>number of words in your article</b> .</span> <span class="notranslate"> There is still intense debate about how long the content is optimal for search engines.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> But how is it possible that pages that cover a topic and only contain five sentences can compete with other in-depth and complete content on Google's search results pages?</span> <span class="notranslate"> Research results shared on the <b><a href="https://dimaslanjaka.github.io/page/safelink.html?url=aHR0cHM6Ly9vcHRpbm1vbnN0ZXIuY29tL3Nlby1yYW5raW5nLWZhY3RvcnMvI3Nlb3Jhbms1" alt="Panduan Lengkap Seo Update 2020" target="_blank" rel="follow">OptinMonster</a></b> page have proven that articles that make it into the top 10 are usually articles with more than 2000 words.</span> <span class="notranslate"> But on the other hand, easily digestible articles only contain around 600-800 words per article, if more, you can divide them into two parts.</span> <span class="notranslate"> So, everything is back again to your goal to make the article.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> In addition, <b>add LSI keywords</b> .</span> <span class="notranslate"> What are LSI <i>keywords</i> ?</span> <span class="notranslate"> LSI <i>keywords</i> or Latent Semantic Indexing <i>keywords</i> are all words or phrases related to the main keywords.</span> <span class="notranslate"> For example you want to discuss the topic of "Healthy Diet," then the LSI <i>keywords</i> are "nutrition," "diet recipes," "lose weight," and so on.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> So, when Google finds your LSI <i>keywords</i> as much as possible through RankBrain, this smart engine will think that your content is comprehensive and be the most appropriate candidate to be displayed on the main page of search results.</span> <span class="notranslate"> The easiest way in a complete SEO guide to finding LSI <i>keywords</i> is to try to find the main keywords on Google and see related searches that appear at the bottom of your search results.</span> </p><h3 class="western"> <span class="notranslate"> <b>Video Content</b></span> </h3><p> <span class="notranslate"> Content in the form of video is being busy being accessed by internet users today.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Based on the results of content marketing reports <strong><a href="https://dimaslanjaka.github.io/page/safelink.html?url=aHR0cHM6Ly9yZXNlYXJjaC5odWJzcG90LmNvbS9yZXBvcnRzL3RoZS1mdXR1cmUtb2YtY29udGVudC1tYXJrZXRpbmc/X2dhPTIuMjY2NDI2ODMwLjExNTMyMTkxMjguMTUwNzgxMDg2NC0xNTQ3ODM4ODEzLjE0ODk1ODE5MDQ=" target="_blank" rel="follow" alt="Panduan Lengkap Seo Update 2020">made by HubSpot</a></strong> , 43% of the population of internet users want video content.</span> <span class="notranslate"> In addition there is also a <strong><a href="https://dimaslanjaka.github.io/page/safelink.html?url=aHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoY3J1bmNoLmNvbS8yMDE3LzA2LzA4L2Npc2NvLWlwLXRyYWZmaWMtc2hvb3RzLXVwLXRvLTMtemV0dGFieXRlcy1ieS0yMDIxLXZpZGVvLXdpbGwtYmUtODAtb2YtaXQv"

<em>traffic</em> on the internet.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> So, take <b>advantage of YouTube which has become</b> <i><b>the</b></i> <b>largest video sharing</b> <i><b>platform</b></i> <b>in search engines</b> .</span> <span class="notranslate"> There are many ways to take advantage of YouTube <em>ratings</em> , for example, frequently quote and link or build <i>links</i> to videos that already exist on YouTube, then you can also share the focus of the <em>website</em> by managing your own YouTube account.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Actually, you don't need to make videos on YouTube on a regular basis like a complete SEO guide, but rather look for ways to at least keep your video audience growing.</span> </p><p> <span class="notranslate"> Also do <i><b>embedding</b></i> <b>videos into article pages on your</b> <i><b>website</b></i> .</span> <span class="notranslate"> This can hold visitors to spend more time on your article pages, as previously discussed related RankBrain from Google.</span> <span class="notranslate"> This method can also reduce the <i>bounce-rate</i> on your <i>website</i> .</span> </p><h3 class="western"> <span class="notranslate"> <b>Quality Link Content</b></span> </h3><p> <span class="notranslate"> We have discussed this a lot in previous articles.</span> <span class="notranslate"> So, this time we will
