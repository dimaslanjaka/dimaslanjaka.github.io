#### Folder Location
Make sure the location of the `XAMPP` folder is outside the drive. Basically xampp only reads from your drive letter. for example:
```text
D:\xampp
C:\xampp
```

#### Changing Port
- Try changing port.
> in **Control Panel** change apache port `80` -> `8081`, `443` -> `4433`
![Port XAMPP](https://i.stack.imgur.com/McjHN.png)
- Open folder `D:\xampp\apache\conf\extra` and open all conf files one by one. (change `D:` with your drive letter)
> Find `<VirtualHost _default_:443>` and change it to `<VirtualHost _default_:4443>`.
>
> Find `ServerName localhost:443`. It’s possible that this hasn’t been set up yet and it reads `ServerName www.example.com:443`. In any case, change it to `ServerName localhost:4443`.

#### Restart XAMPP
- Stop and Start apache
- Stop and start mysql
