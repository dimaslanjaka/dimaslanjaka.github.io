  Strategy Board Up To Increase traffic   &lt;/h2&gt;When you decide content were the title of the article which has a    disbursement rate is high then the keyword is usually controlled by    a blog board who had already published articles with keywords and    able to dominate search results in the best position, so that the    article's posting that you make be able to compete there some    technique or strategy you use in order to get traffic from the    title.   &lt;br&gt;Some strategies to compete with the top blogs that you can try are    as follows:   &lt;br&gt;&lt;h3&gt;   #1. Create a title with Long Tail Keyword   &lt;/h3&gt;When you know that the keywords that you will use to make the title    of the article has a level of competition is very tough so make the    title of the article is to use    &lt;a href="http://google.me/search?q=long%20tail%20keyword" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow"&gt;    long tail keywords    &lt;/a&gt;   .   &lt;br&gt;How do I make sure that the title that I created has a tough    competition level?   &lt;br&gt;The trick is simple, just do a search using the keywords that you    are a target, if the search results are found millions of search    results can be ascertained that these keywords have a tough    competition level.   &lt;br&gt;For example example for the keyword   &lt;strong&gt;"how to create a blog",&lt;/strong&gt; when checked on google    keyword planer, this keyword has the search rate is very    extraordinary (popular keywords), can be seen in the following    figure:   &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-J2F_XRM3ynM/VyvJ2u1OkCI/AAAAAAAADug/BHcBXoUzlt88M4C0lOfzu6wnPuJULFSkgCLcB/s1600/cara-membuat-blog.png" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow"&gt;    &lt;img alt="kata kunci persaingaan tinggi" border="0" height="56" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-J2F_XRM3ynM/VyvJ2u1OkCI/AAAAAAAADug/BHcBXoUzlt88M4C0lOfzu6wnPuJULFSkgCLcB/s280/cara-membuat-blog.png" title="keyword high persaingaan" width="280"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br&gt;The key word turned out to have an average number of searches per    month as many as 90,500 searches, no wonder many great blogs to    target this keyword, and indeed after check in keyword search    results at this level of competition is quite tough which is about    6,300,000 the result, as shown in the figure below:   &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Fn2fYSrD3IE/VyvHIIxt35I/AAAAAAAADuU/6YXayHKGxuITvtut0gkO-Y5E5Hcs9puVACLcB/s1600/kata-kunci-dengan-persaingan-sulit.png" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow"&gt;    &lt;img border="0" height="60" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Fn2fYSrD3IE/VyvHIIxt35I/AAAAAAAADuU/6YXayHKGxuITvtut0gkO-Y5E5Hcs9puVACLcB/s280/kata-kunci-dengan-persaingan-sulit.png" width="280"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br&gt;This means that if targeting these keywords then you have to    compete with other articles 6,200,000.   &lt;br&gt;One way that you can rely on to compete with these keywords is    presenting the article title using    &lt;a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;nv=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=id&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://strukturkode.blogspot.co.id/2014/10/apa-itu-longtail-keywords.html&amp;usg=ALkJrhjA5ENXSh4RQmgmzNnqC7y6tBRvIQ" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow"&gt;    long tail keywords    &lt;/a&gt;   , title long tail keywords will be able to make your article likely    to appear with a variety of relevant keywords so that your articles    will have many opportunities to be found in search results and can    increase traffic to your blog.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;As explained by internet marketing experts neil patel, how     &lt;a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;nv=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=id&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://neilpatel.com/2015/03/26/how-to-generate-20000-monthly-search-visitors-through-long-tail-traffic/&amp;usg=ALkJrhjmuRoRlIMb1oWW1za4JitOJfXpIA" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow"&gt;     how to bring in 20,000 visitors in one month     &lt;/a&gt;    with longtail keywords, states that if you consistently publish     articles with long-tail content and quality are consistent with     the use of the title long tail keywords then you will see an     increase in traffic on the blog you are significan.    &lt;/blockquote&gt;Likewise, based on research conducted by statista that onpage seo    optimization average successful when it involves long tail keywords    for the title, meaning that when you involve    &lt;a href="http://google.me/search?q=optimization%20seo%20onpage" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow"&gt;    optimization seo onpage    &lt;/a&gt;   , in order to get the most out onpage optimization then you can    involve titles that use long tail keywords.   &lt;br&gt;So what is the    &lt;a href="http://google.me/search?q=number%20of%20words%20for%20the%20title%20of%20long%20tail%20keywords" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow"&gt;    number of words for the title of long tail keywords    &lt;/a&gt;   are the most ideal ?, the answer is 4 to 5 words or more, the    longer the title that you create for your blog articles easier it    will be that article a ranking in the search results with a variety    of relevant keywords.   &lt;br&gt;If you choose the title of the short tail or short title which only    consists of three syllables or less for keywords with high-level    competition, then your title will be difficult to compete with    blogs on board, because in general the titles of articles composed    of three syllables or less usually been controlled by top blogs    that already has a very good reputation in the eyes of search    engines and already has a long lifespan.   &lt;br&gt;Read also:    &lt;a href="http://google.tk/search?q=how%20to%20choose%20the%20right%20keywords%20longtail" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow"&gt;    how to choose the right keywords longtail    &lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;h3&gt;   #2. Create Article Length   &lt;/h3&gt;The term content is king (Content is king) is true, and content    length of 1000 to 2000 words or more it tends to be more dominant    in the eyes seach enggine, and in fact the longer a piece of    content that the article has a chance to appear on the first page    google better.   &lt;br&gt;Based on the &lt;em&gt;analysis of the SERP IQ &lt;/em&gt;, which performed an    analysis of 20,000 keywords stated that the average article capable    of appearing on the first page of google (page one) is an article    of 2,000 words or more, the more the number of words in the content    of the rankings in the search results will tend either.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-stGgnWul2qI/Vyv3rQr4SrI/AAAAAAAADuw/B0Rtx01LhDALG_c11BSFBfJHNgjHjaOmACLcB/s1600/wordcountcontent.jpg" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow"&gt;    &lt;img alt="jumlah kata dalam artikel" border="0" height="225" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-stGgnWul2qI/Vyv3rQr4SrI/AAAAAAAADuw/B0Rtx01LhDALG_c11BSFBfJHNgjHjaOmACLcB/s280/wordcountcontent.jpg" title="the number of words in the article" width="280"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br&gt;We can see in the graph above, that content consists of 2,000 words    or more have a chance to appear in the top 10 Google search    results, the more the content length paka position in the search    results will get better, but you can see that the first rank    occupied by the article which has a number of words a little more    (2416 words) than the second article and 3rd (2494 da 2492 words),    it indicates that google is also concerned about the quality of the    content itself, the quality of a content and the longer the number    of words presented in a content then it will be very good.   &lt;br&gt;Finding Articles:    &lt;a href="http://www.webmanajemen.com/search/?q=How%20to%20write%20quality%20articles%20seo" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow"&gt;    How to write quality articles seo    &lt;/a&gt;   preferred search engine   &lt;br&gt;&lt;h3&gt;   #3.
