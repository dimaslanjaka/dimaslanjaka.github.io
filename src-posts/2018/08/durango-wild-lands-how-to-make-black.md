Bleach aims to get the basic         color of the clothes to white so that they get the maximum black         color.(note; you should bleach clothes several times so that you get a         really white base color)     </li><li>        after bleached, we color the nail to be mixed with dye or black dye that         has been made beforehand.     </li></ol>after doing the above process correctly, black clothes will be produced as     we want. <br>a few tips for getting the maximum black: <br><ol><li>        bleach clothes several times to get the white base color, at least         twice the mixing process with bleach.     </li><li>        use a burnt cattail during the combustion process (skewer) for dye         making     </li><li>        use cattail which has RGB color information with values ​​below 30     </li><li>        the bleach process does not reduce the processing limit     </li><li>        the dye mixing process with clothing reduces the process limit on the         packing.     </li><li>        use clothes that can be processed more than 1 time (pictures of 2x or         more hammers that can be seen in the description.     </li><li>        if you can't make bleach / dye then get help from other people or         members of your clan who can make it for you.     </li></ol>so many tutorials and tips on getting black clothes, and finally thanks for     the criticism and suggestions.
