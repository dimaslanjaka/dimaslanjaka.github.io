<p>Using Creative Commons Public Licenses</p>
<p>Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and<br>conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share<br>original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright<br>and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The<br>following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not<br>exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.</p>
<pre><code> Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
 intended for use by those authorized to give the public
 permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
 copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
 irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
 and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
 Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
 applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
 material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
 material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
 licensed material, or material used under an exception or
 limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

 Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
 licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
 licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
 the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
 example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
 copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
 licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
 other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
 the licensed material may still be restricted for other
 reasons, including because others have copyright or other
 rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
 such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
 Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
 respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations

<p>Section 2 – Scope.</p>
<p>  a. License grant.</p>
<pre><code>   1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
      the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
      non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
      exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

        a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
           in part; and

        b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

   2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
      Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
      License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
      its terms and conditions.

   3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
      6(a).

   4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
      Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
      all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
      and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
      Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
      authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
      necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
      technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
      Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
      simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
      (4) never produces Adapted Material.

   5. Downstream recipients.

        a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
           recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
           receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
           Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
           Public License.

        b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
           Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
           automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
           exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
           under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.

        c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
           any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
           apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
           Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
           Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
           Material.

   6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
      may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
      are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
      with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
      the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
      provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
</code></pre>
<p>  b. Other rights.</p>
<pre><code>   1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
      licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
      privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
      the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
      assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
      extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
      Rights, but not otherwise.

   2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
      Public License.

   3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
      collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
      Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
      under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
      licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
      reserves any right to collect such royalties.

<p>Section 3 – License Conditions.</p>
<p>Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the<br>following conditions.</p>
<p>  a. Attribution.</p>
<pre><code>   1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
      form), You must:

        a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
           with the Licensed Material:

             i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                Material and any others designated to receive
                attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                designated);

            ii. a copyright notice;

           iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                warranties;

             v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                extent reasonably practicable;

        b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
           retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

        c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
           Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
           hyperlink to, this Public License.

   2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
      reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
      which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
      reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
      hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
      information.

   3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
      information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
      reasonably practicable.
</code></pre>
<p>  b. ShareAlike.</p>
<pre><code> In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
 Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.

   1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
      license with the same License Elements, this version or
      later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.

   2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
      Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
      in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
      context in which You Share Adapted Material.

   3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
      or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
      Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
      rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.
</code></pre>
<p>Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.</p>
<p>Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that<br>apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:</p>
<p>  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right<br>     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial<br>     portion of the contents of the database;</p>
<p>  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database<br>     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database<br>     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database<br>     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,<br>     including for purposes of Section 3(b); and</p>
<p>  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share<br>     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not<br>replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed<br>Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.</p>
<p>Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.</p>
<p>  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE<br>     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS<br>     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF<br>     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,<br>     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,<br>     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,<br>     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT<br>     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT<br>     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
<p>  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE<br>     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,<br>     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,<br>     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,<br>     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR<br>     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN<br>     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR<br>     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR<br>     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
<p>  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided<br>     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent<br>     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and<br>     waiver of all liability.</p>
<p>Section 6 – Term and Termination.</p>
<p>  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and<br>     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with<br>     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License<br>     terminate automatically.</p>
<p>  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under<br>     Section 6(a), it reinstates:</p>
<pre><code>   1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
      it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
      violation; or

   2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
 right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
 of this Public License.
</code></pre>
<p>  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the<br>     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop<br>     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so<br>     will not terminate this Public License.</p>
<p>  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public<br>     License.</p>
<p>Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different<br>     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.</p>
<p>  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the<br>     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and<br>     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.</p>
<p>Section 8 – Interpretation.</p>
<p>  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and<br>     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose<br>     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully<br>     be made without permission under this Public License.</p>
<p>  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is<br>     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the<br>     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision<br>     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License<br>     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and<br>     conditions.</p>
<p>  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no<br>     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the<br>     Licensor.</p>
<p>  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted<br>     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities<br>     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal<br>     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.</p>
