Full Movie</strong> Watch Devils Devotees Free, Streaming Servant Devils free Look at Indon Pengabdi Satan Films,</span> </p>  <p> <span class="notranslate"> <strong>Satan Servant Synopsis (2017)</strong></span> </p>  <p> <span class="notranslate"> <strong>Servant Satan</strong> , both versions 1980 and 2017, rests on the same premise: instability in the household sphere.</span> <span class="notranslate"> The first version directed by Sisworo Gautama Putra opened with a funeral procession, followed by a narrative about the absence of a mother figure, which made the children at home seem to lose their grip.</span> <span class="notranslate"> While the latest version by Joko Anwar, the remake of the old version of Pengabdi Satan, was opened by economic difficulties.</span> </p>  <p> <span class="notranslate"> Mother (played by Ayu Laksmi) in the latest <strong>Devotion Servant</strong> is a singer who is the backbone of the family - different from the mother in the old version which is implicitly described as a housekeeper and child.</span> <span class="notranslate"> As a supporter of the economy, the role of mother is clearly irreplaceable by domestic servants like Darminah.</span> <span class="notranslate"> And considering the absence of demites under the guise of domestic help, then terror certainly must come from other figures.</span> <span class="notranslate"> The question: where from?</span> </p>  <p> <span class="notranslate"> The plot in this film was sourced from within the household.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Not because of the absence of the mother and the lack of faith, but because of the old scandal that was buried tightly.</span> <span class="notranslate"> A character named Budiman (Egy Fedly) tells that mother had a bad relationship with her father-in-law, her grandmother's children (Elly D. Luthan).</span> <span class="notranslate"> First, grandma does not like the profession of a mother as a singer, and secondly, grandmother wants to have grandchildren quickly.</span> </p>  <p> <span class="notranslate"> The situation is increasingly complicated when it is known that mothers are unable to have children.</span> <span class="notranslate"> My mother then tried to improve the household situation by going to a forbidden sect that could make her descendant.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Through mysterious ways, successful mothers have four children and their families are happy.</span> <span class="notranslate"> However, the catastrophe that he had delayed for so long finally arrived when his youngest child turned seven years old.</span> </p>  <p> <span class="notranslate"> It is clear that the source of the disaster is the mother's dark efforts.</span> <span class="notranslate"> However, if drawn further, this effort is actually only the mother's response to the pressure of her in-laws (grandmother).</span> <span class="notranslate"> In other words, hajat and all the conservative values ​​adopted by the grandmother have contributed to pushing the origin of disaster.</span> <span class="notranslate"> So when at the end of the film the grandmother tries to help her family, it may not only show her good intentions, but her regret.</span> <br><span class="notranslate"> Ustadz defeat</span> <br><span class="notranslate"> Another difference from the Servant Servant of Joko Anwar's version is the depiction of the Ustadz figure who is no longer appearing as a savior.</span> <span class="notranslate"> In this film, Pak Ustaz (Arswendi Bening Swara) is a person who keeps feeling sad and angry because of his son's death.</span> <span class="notranslate"> He was finally defeated by Satan.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Even so, the ustaz figure in the new version is not just made weak.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Just like the depiction of a mother's figure, the figure of Pak Ustaz was also formed as the original version of the Devotion of Servant was changed.</span> </p>  <p> <span class="notranslate"> The key to changing the character of Pak Ustaz is in the character Hendra (Dimas Aditya).</span> <span class="notranslate"> The figure of Hendra, whose role is somewhat similar to Herman's in the old version, is a young man who approached his sister in the family of the Devotees of Satan.</span> <span class="notranslate"> However, what distinguishes the new version of the Servant Servant, Hendra is described as the son of Pak Ustaz.</span> <span class="notranslate"> These threads between the two figures made Pak Ustaz look like an ordinary human.</span> </p>  <p> <span class="notranslate"> Such characterization of Pak Ustaz is arguably the right strategy.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Because, the narration needed by today's audience might not be a narrative that deifies religious leaders.</span> <span class="notranslate"> It is important to stress that even religious leaders are only human beings who can err, have feelings of sadness and anger.</span> <span class="notranslate"> They were honorable people, but not saviors, as described by the old version of the Servant Servant.</span> </p>  <p> <span class="notranslate"> In the old version of Devotion Service, the figure of Pak Ustaz appeared very heroic.</span> <span class="notranslate"> He not only succeeded in conquering Darminah, but was diligent in claiming the troubled family to diligently pray.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Initially, the old version of Pak Ustaz in the Devotion Service did not immediately get attention.</span> <span class="notranslate"> The father, who was described as busy with parliamentary work, repeatedly ignored Pak Ustaz for various reasons.</span> <span class="notranslate"> While one by one disaster had occurred at home, and only Pak Ustaz could save them.</span> </p>  <p> <span class="notranslate"> The <strong>old version of the Servant Servant story</strong> invites the audience to hope anxiously, waiting for the family in the film to immediately care about the advice of Ustaz.</span> <span class="notranslate"> While waiting, the audience was also invited to condemn family behavior that ignored religious teachings.</span> <span class="notranslate"> When finally the family was urged and finally saved by Ustaz, maybe the words that would appear were like this: "So, listen to Ustaz, and don't forget to pray."</span> </p>  <p> <span class="notranslate"> In the new version of Satan Servant, Ustadz is more attached to his social space.</span> <span class="notranslate"> It doesn't come from everywhere;</span> <span class="notranslate"> its role is no more than what we commonly find everyday: giving advice and filling in religious events.</span> </p>  <p> <span class="notranslate"> This description may be a statement from Joko Anwar, that dependence on savior figures is indeed irrelevant.</span> <span class="notranslate"> If we remember, a similar narrative had been present in the first film Joko Anwar, Janji Joni (2006).</span> <span class="notranslate"> When Joni asked the police for help to pursue the thief, the police officer asked Joni to fill out the report.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Finally, Joni tried his own fate.</span> </p>  <p> <span class="notranslate"> Likewise, Rini and her siblings had to fight against the devil.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Joko Anwar does not invite the audience to hope for anyone.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Sources of safety always move along the storyline.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Initially there might have been Hendra and Mr. Ustadz who was staying digadang would save Rini and her younger siblings.</span> <span class="notranslate"> However, when both of them were proven to have failed, salvation was then carried out by Rini and her family, who received references from Budiman's writings.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Even so, the writings of Budiman, who said that taking care of each other were a way out, were wrong.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Until finally, when Rini and her family were pressed, deus ex machina appeared: help suddenly came from Budiman and (spirit) grandmother at the last moment.</span> <br><span class="notranslate"> Victory of Servant of Satan</span> <br><span class="notranslate"> As a horror film, the Devotion Devils packaging is fairly successful in presenting a tense atmosphere.</span> <span class="notranslate"> When the new film starts for a few minutes, through the expressions and sayings of Bondi (Nasar Annuz), the audience is immediately made goose bumps by the presence of the mother.</span> <span class="notranslate"> For every scary scene, the film always plants first, so that each scene feels natural and does not come suddenly.</span> <span class="notranslate"> For example, before Tony (Endy Arfian) was terrorized by his mother's song on the radio, it was first shown that Tony was used to listening to the radio every night.</span> </p>  <p> <span class="notranslate"> Terror that occurred in this film was also made closely related to the story.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Ian (M. Adhiyat), for example, looks totally free from the terror of the mother's soul — only the grandmother's soul terrorizes Ian.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Ian could even casually argue when Rini asked Bondi's confession that saw the devil mother on the stairs.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Similarly, when Ian was not allowed to try the camera toy containing the slideshow that Bondi held.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Instantly, Bondi immediately saw the apparition of the mother's soul in his camera.</span> </p>  <p> <span class="notranslate"> Unfortunately, those impressions can only be understood when the film has finished.</span> <span class="notranslate"> The amount of plothole, and a twist that is not well built, causes this film to not be digested immediately.</span> <span class="notranslate"> At the end of the film, information is made so piling up, without tight continuity.</span> <span class="notranslate"> When Budiman revised his writing, the audience was not shown the process.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Nor did the audience see Tony and Rini studying Budiman's writings.</span> <span class="notranslate"> There is not even a hint that Budiman owns a car — which is not easy to turn on.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Suddenly, everything felt instant.</span> </p>  <p> <span class="notranslate"> As a result, although it contains a discourse relevant to the present, Joko Anwar's Servant Servant is still difficult to call a strong work.</span> <span class="notranslate"> The final half of Servant Devotion can be said to be chaotic.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Various narratives that try to emulate conservative narratives about women's fertility, the profession of artists, and the role of religious leaders, are less well-cultivated.</span> <span class="notranslate"> The consideration that made the mother become a member of the satanist sect was not at all told.</span> <span class="notranslate"> His feud with grandmother was also only spoken verbally by other characters — even though, according to Budiman's story, those two things were at the root of the problems that afflicted the Rini family.</span> </p>  <p> <span class="notranslate"> These shortcomings might be Joko Anwar paying in the next Devotion Service.</span> <span class="notranslate"> According to news circulating, Joko Anwar indeed made this remake as a prequel with two chapters.</span> <span class="notranslate"> In other words, there is still one more film before the story really reaches the original version of the Devotion Servant.</span> <span class="notranslate"> It is probable that the vacant plot will be answered in the next Devotion Servant.</span> <span class="notranslate"> The audience questions about the conversation between the father and mother, Budiman's whisper to Hendra, until the mother and grandmother's conflict might be answered later — just as Insidious 2 fills the void in Insidious 1</span> </p>  <p> <span class="notranslate"> So far, the Demonic Servant audience has reached more than two million.</span> <span class="notranslate"> At the Indonesian Film Festival, Pengabdi Setan entered the best film nominations — plus 12 other nominations.</span> <span class="notranslate"> Various conversations in cyberspace, both those created thanks to memes and reviews, also have the potential to continue to extend Satan's Servant's breath.</span> <span class="notranslate"> These achievements make the next Satanic Servant clear a reasonable step.</span> <span class="notranslate"> And that has been a victory for all the teams behind the Servant of Satan.</span> </p>  </div>  <p class="desc"> <span class="notranslate"> Like &amp;
