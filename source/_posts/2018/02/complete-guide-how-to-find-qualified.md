But in some cases (especially for internet marketers who are involved in SEO), buying an expired domain can be an option that has its own advantages compared to buying a new domain.<br>What are the benefits? The main thing is to bypass the authority that is generally owned by expired domains, which of course is not owned by a new domain. So later, the website can be easier and faster ranking on search engines.<br><h2> 3 Main Functions of Expired Domain:</h2><h3> - As Moneysite</h3>With the authority it has, the expired domain can be a potential moneysite.<br><h3> - As a PBN</h3>Expired domain can also be made a strong <a href="http://weblight.in/?lite_url=https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c%3Fdepth%3D2%26nv%3D1%26rurl%3Dtranslate.google.com%26sl%3Did%26sp%3Dnmt4%26tl%3Den%26u%3Dhttp://www.rohadiright.com/pbn-untuk-link-building-seo%26usg%3DALkJrhhpb1n12ztzd_anaE97iunEaUXFBA&amp;ts=1518276508&amp;sig=AOyes_R1k_fHxfVc5LIzKjgwk1ymGKmTug" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow"> PBN </a> (Private Blog Network) to boost the ranking of web-web moneysite on search engines.<br><h3> - As 301 Redirects</h3>Finally, an expired domain can be used to bypass linkjuice to a new domain with a 301 redirect technique (not recommended for beginners, use at your own risk).<br><h2> Domain Stages After Expired</h2>Before going any further, there are some things you should know about expired domains.<br>Once the domain becomes expired, there are several steps that must be passed. For each registrar (Godaddy, Namecheap, Dynadot, etc.) this stage may vary in time.<br>Here are the stages of the domain from the first expired until the domain is auctioned or deleted from the registrar. In this stage I use <a href="http://weblight.in/?lite_url=https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c%3Fdepth%3D2%26nv%3D1%26rurl%3Dtranslate.google.com%26sl%3Did%26sp%3Dnmt4%26tl%3Den%26u%3Dhttps://www.godaddy.com/%26usg%3DALkJrhjPdhL9Hq_ADr-a7ydWz9Z_qcXyEA&amp;ts=1518276508&amp;sig=AOyes_Q9FxJuKgFWayX9gwf6EXJMt0CNzQ" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow"> Godaddy </a> as a reference, for other registrar could be different period of time.<br><div id="a-tablepress-1-scroll-wrapper"><table id="a-tablepress-1"> <thead><tr> <th>Days after domain expired </th> <th>Information </th> </tr></thead> <tbody><tr> <td>Day 1 </td><td>Domains are in Grace Period status. Godaddy tries to bill and renew automatically (if the domain owner is set to auto-renew) to extend the domain's active life </td></tr><tr> <td>Day 5 </td><td>Godaddy tried to do the bills and renew automatically for the second time. If it still fails, the domain will be directly inserted into domain parking. At this stage, the domain owner can still extend the domain without being charged a fine </td></tr><tr> <td>Day 12 </td><td>Godaddy tries to do automatic renew for the third or last time.At this stage, the domain owner can still extend the domain without being charged a fine </td></tr><tr> <td>Day 19 </td><td>Domains can be renewed domain owners with a $ 80.00 fine fee </td></tr><tr> <td>Day 26 </td><td>Domain entered into the auction at Godaddy (https://auctions.godaddy.com) with BID system </td></tr><tr> <td>Day 36 </td><td>Domain auction expires. If the domain is still unsold, the domain will be put into a closeout auction (closeout auction). In closeout auction this applies BIN system (Buy it Now) </td></tr><tr> <td>Day 41 </td><td>Closeout auction ends </td></tr><tr> <td>Day 42 </td><td>Last chance for the old owner to renew the domain. If the old owner renews the domain at this stage, the cost of the auction winner / closeout will be refunded </td></tr><tr> <td>Day 43 </td><td>Domain submitted to the winner of the auction / closeout. If until this stage the domain is not also sold (no one doing BID or BIN) then the domain will be submitted to the registry </td></tr><tr> <td>Day 44 </td><td>Domain back to registry and in Redemption Period status for 30 days. In this stage the domain can only be extended by the old owner, of course with the cost of a fine </td></tr><tr> <td>Day 74 </td><td>Domain in Pending Delete status for 5 days. In this stage the domain can no longer be extended by the old owner </td></tr><tr> <td>Day 79 </td><td>Domain status is Deleted. The domain is re-released to the public and can be purchased like a new domain. Age domain is also set back to 0 </td></tr></tbody> </table></div><h2> Aged Domains vs. Dropped Domains</h2>You may often hear the term <em>aged domain</em> and <em>dropped domains</em> , especially if you are interested in the linkbuilding method via PBN.<br>Then what is the difference between aged domain and dropped domain? Which is better between the two types of expired domains?<br>Aged domains and dropped domains have their respective deficiencies and advantages. But to help you differentiate and choose which one is more suitable for you, let me give you a little explanation of the difference.<br>From the table above, aged domain is if you buy expired domain with auction system between day 26th to day 41. Why ? Because you renew (extend the active period) domain before the domain is returned to the registry.<br>While the expired domain dropped domain category if you do renew (more precisely buy) domain after day-79. Why ?Because you bought after the domain is returned to the registry and the domain age is set back to 0.<br><strong>Advantages of aged domains:</strong> <br>- Can be distinguished between deindex domains with those still indexed <br>- Domain age is not reset to 0<br><strong>Lack of aged domains:</strong> <br>- The price is more expensive because it pays the cost of domain + renew <br>- Less flexible in choosing a domain name, because it adjusts to the stock in the auction / auction.<br><strong>Advantages of dropped domains:</strong> <br>- The price is cheaper because it is just like buying a new domain <br>- More flexible in choosing a domain name due to abundant stock<br><strong>Disadvantages of dropped domains:</strong> <br>- It is hard to distinguish between deindex or not, because almost all dropped domain indexnya return 0 <br>- Age domain reset to 0<br>Aged domains and dropped domains have their own shortcomings and advantages, if you want to find expired domains either for Moneysite or PBN, just adjust it with budget and requirement.<br><h2> Websites that provide list / list of expired domains</h2>After knowing the function and the difference of expired domain, you also want to know where to get the list of expired domains.Here is the list:<br><ul><li> <a href="http://weblight.in/?lite_url=https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c%3Fdepth%3D2%26nv%3D1%26rurl%3Dtranslate.google.com%26sl%3Did%26sp%3Dnmt4%26tl%3Den%26u%3Dhttps://www.expireddomains.net/%26usg%3DALkJrhhjkoVTOqBJSzIlSEce0Z1fhOLjcg&amp;ts=1518276508&amp;sig=AOyes_TrF-xiraxC9oL3o75Z4BzwrVZBCQ" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow"> ExpiredDomains.net </a> </li></ul>The most popular and longest mistaking service that provides a list of expired domains for free<br><ul><li> <a href="http://weblight.in/?lite_url=https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c%3Fdepth%3D2%26nv%3D1%26rurl%3Dtranslate.google.com%26sl%3Did%26sp%3Dnmt4%26tl%3Den%26u%3Dhttps://www.domcop.com/%26usg%3DALkJrhiTrZMUxjKecZYi7nCsCxXpS5pDLA&amp;ts=1518276508&amp;sig=AOyes_QzUQI5XbBPYITl4uHcXMXGUNlO6Q" rel="noopener noreferer nofollow"> Domcop.com </a> </li></ul>The premium service is arguably the most complete in presenting a list of expired domain databases.<br>The two services above are the ones I use most often in searching for expired domains.

Sometimes there is a niche moneysite is quite unique so it is difficult to find expired domain with a similar niche, there is also a niche its quite common as travel or health that expired its domain is relatively easier to find.<br>To check the domain niche you can use Wayback Machine &amp; History Domain or use Topical Trust Flow metrics in Majestic.com.<br><h3> Domain name</h3>If used as a PBN, the domain name in my opinion does not really matter. Short and memorable domain names are even better than KOD (keyword on domain).<br>Conversely for Moneysite, domain with partial match (incoming keyword inthe domain name) I think is one of the best, such as: Buzz<strong>Tattoes.com</strong> , John <strong>Design.com</strong> , Nina <strong>Weddings.com</strong>and so on.<br><h3> Extensions</h3>The domain extension is actually free here, but if it could be better .com, be it for moneysite and PBN.
