The hreflang characteristic adds a flag to web crawlers that a client questioning in dialect "x" will need this outcome rather than a page with comparative substance in dialect "y". For instance, in the event that you make a Spanish-dialect adaptation of your<br><br>English-dialect landing page, you would label it as "Español" by utilizing hreflang="es" so that searchers with an IP address that an internet searcher has motivation to accept is in a<br><br>Spanish-talking nation are served that page in Spanish rather than the English rendition.

That looks like this:<br><br><pre>&lt;link rel="alternate" href="http://example.com/" hreflang="x-default" /&gt;</pre><h4>Hreflang's Effect on Rankings<br></h4>Hreflang attributes may not help you increase traffic; instead, the goal of&nbsp;using them is to serve the right content to the right users.
