    What is auto insurance?<br />
    It is an agreement between you and the company that defends you against any monetary loss in the happening of an
    accident or theft. In trade for your paying a premium, the insurance company agrees to pay your losses as summarized
    in your guidelines.<br />

    Auto insurance is made obligatory by most of the states and this provides you with some economic protection in case
    of an accident or any misfortune. But this information is not enough for an individual to decide whether he should
    take up auto insurance or not. For this, you need to more about different kinds of aspects provided by various
    schemes. So let us learn how this works and what is obtainable from it.<br />
    Different types of Auto insurance:<br />
    <br />
    &#8226; Property - This includes losses such as damage to or theft of your car.<br />
    <br />
    &#8226; Liability - This includes your official responsibility to others for physical injury or assets damage.<br />
    <br />
    &#8226; Medical - Includes the cost of treating injuries, therapy and any other kind of medical expenses.<br />
    <br />
    Fundamentals of Auto Insurance<br />
    <br />
    You need to understand some basic things about your scheme. Auto insurance might be different in some ways but here
    are some common things about it that will mostly remain the same.<br />
    <br />
    &#8226; Your policy will cover you and your family members listed on the auto insurance, whether you are driving
    your car or someone else's car (with their authorization).<br />
    <br />
    &#8226; Your policy will also provide protection if someone who is not in your scheme is driving your car with your
    approval.<br />
    <br />
    &#8226; Your personal vehicle insurance only covers driving for personal reasons, whether you're commuting to your
    office, running household errands or taking a trip to another city. But it will not provide any kind of cover if you
    use your car for profitable purpose. For instance, if you rent out your car or use it for delivery purposes.<br />
    <br />
    &#8226; Personal auto insurance will also not offer coverage if you use your car to supply transportation to others
    through a ride-sharing service such as Uber or OLA. A number of auto insurers, on the other hand, are now offering
    supplemental products (at an extra cost) that expand coverage for automobile owners providing ride-sharing services
    as well.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Is Auto Insurance Mandatory?</b><br />
    <br />
    Requirements differ from state to state and you might have to get it depending on your state's legal guidelines. If
    you are financing a car, your lender may also have its own necessities and might want you to get it. Almost every
    state requires car owners to take:<br />
    <br />
    &#8226; Bodily injury liability - which covers expenses related to injuries or death that you or another person has
    faced in an accident while driving your car.<br />
    <br />
    &#8226; Property damage liability - which compensates others for damage that you or another person who was driving
    your car might have caused to another vehicle or other property, such as any boundary marker, any building or pole
    in the accident.<br />
    <br />
    These things make it compulsory to enroll in one policy as soon as possible. This will not only help you but also
    your family members. So make sure you take up a policy as soon as possible for a safe and secure drive.<br />
    <h3>
      Does Auto Insurance Help If You Are a Victim of a Hit and Run Accident?</h3>
    Unfortunately, the news about a hit and run is on the radar every so often. A pedestrian or a car driver is hit by a
    vehicle and the driver responsible for the accident speeds off without owning up to his actions by checking on the
    victims and providing his or her contact info to police.<br />
    <br />
    What defines a hit and run accident?<br />
    <br />
    A hit and run incident occurs when one driver crashes into a person or a car and intentionally drives on in order to
    avoid prosecution or accountability for resulting death, injury and/or damages.<br />
    <br />
    Should you become victimized in a hit and run event, never pursue the fleeing car. You might find yourself in a road
    rage incident or the like. Leave the chasing to the cops who are trained in this type of thing. What you should do
    immediately following the crash is to alert the law enforcers.<br />
    <br />
    For your best interest sake, gather as much information as you can about the event. This will help police catch the
    driver who collided into you. It will also add to the chances of your submitted insurance claim be processed to your
    advantage.<br />
    Here is what the insurance underwriters tell victims of hit and run accidents to do.<br />
    <br />
    As said, the more information you gather about the case, the more chances of it ending to your benefit.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Tell authorities about facts by providing the following:</b><br />
    <br />
    &#8226; The make and model of the other car or vehicle<br />
    &#8226; The license plate number of the other car<br />
    &#8226; How to get in touch with people who witnessed the accident<br />
    &#8226; The time and place when and where the accident occurred<br />
    &#8226; Images taken of your car immediately following the collision. (leftover paint of the other car on your
    vehicle will assist authorities in locating the other driver and pinning charges as it will help the insurance
    company determine a good outcome for your claim)<br />
    &#8226; Physician's report about any injuries you or your passengers incurred as a result of the accident<br />
    <br />
    If the driver who slammed into you and drove off without accepting liability is caught, you can submit an auto claim
    directly to his or her insurance company. But, should the other driver happen to be with insufficient insurance
    coverage or no coverage at all, you might want to resort to an attorney's services.<br />
    <br />
    Another avenue to pursue is your own insurance coverage. If the hit and run driver does not have proper insurance to
    cover your losses, you can file a claim with your insurance company. States differ in policy as far as the claims
    process goes, so you'll have to do the research. Generally speaking, if you have uninsured motorist bodily injury
    coverage, you will be covered for medical bills and if you have uninsured motorist property damage insurance, you
    will be covered for related auto repair work.<br />
    <br />
    Though there are various US states that do not cover you with these forms of insurance, they should cover you if you
    have personal injury protection coverage as well as medical payments insurance and collision coverage.<br />
    <br />
    Of course, it's best to speak with a knowledgeable independent insurance agent that has experience in this type of
    claim, so make sure you hook up with a reliable source!<br />

    Best Auto Insurance<br />
    <br />
    The truth is that there is no one company or policy that is considered the "best auto insurance." What is true is
    that for every individual there is a policy that is the best for you. There are three main types of auto insurance
    policies available to the average driver; liability coverage, comprehensive coverage, collision coverage.<br />
    <br />
    Generally speaking, liability coverage is the least expensive, followed by comprehensive, then collision being the
    most expensive. However, there are many more factors that go into the cost of a policy. Age of primary driver, the
    location of the vehicle to be insured, make and model of vehicle, driving record of primary driver, and even the
    safety ratings of the vehicle all go into considering the cost of your policy.<br />
    <br />
    By law, every car that us driven in the United States must be insured. The mandatory nature of this can make it
    tempting to purchase the cheapest policy possible, especially if you are not a rich person. Many people have made
    that assumption and bought the cheapest possible insurance only to find out after an accident or a theft that the
    policy they bought didn't cover anything! The best auto insurance is most likely not the cheapest. Liability
    coverage does not cover any damage to your car that occurs in an accident, regardless of which driver is at fault.
    It also doesn't cover and theft or the vehicle, which could leave you one sorry car-less driver.<br />
    <br />
    Comprehensive coverage will cover a stolen vehicle and is usually only a little bit more expensive than liability
    coverage. When is comes to auto insurance, it is best to not be a cheapskate because you could end up losing much
    more in the end. Comprehensive pretty much cover anything other than a collision, such as acts of nature ie. rain or
    fire.<br />
    <br />
    Collision coverage will give you the most complete coverage and because of this, it is usually quite a bit more than
    comprehensive coverage, on average 50% more. Collision coverage will cover any damage done to your car from a crash
    of any kind, whether it be a collision with another car or crashing into a tree. This type of policy will also cover
    everything that is covered under comprehensive. Although the monthly payments might be pricey they can pay off big
    time in case of a major accident or any other kind of incident.<br />
    <br />
    Keep in mind that there is always a deductible that needs to be paid when you file a claim. Usually, the higher your
    deductible, the lower the monthly payments are. One might be tempted to opt for a high deductible to keep their
    monthly payments down, but this tactic is short-sighted and could bite you in the rear or you ever do need to make a
    claim.<br />
    <br />
    Hopefully, these tips and pointers have helped you decide on the best auto insurance for you!
